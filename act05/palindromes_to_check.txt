A babe might blow between two straining cheeks
A babe upon her breast,unnatural
A baby? ‘Ay! the child is well enough,
A beam in darkness: let it grow.
A beast would roar so tortured,but a man,
A beaten, breathless, miserable soul?
A beckoning mystery, or a troubling fear.
A better joy for two than came by that!
A blank last moment, crowded suddenly
A blot ... as little even as a tear ...
A bold girl with black eyebrows and red lips,
A book in one hand,mere statistics, if
A book upon my knees, to counterfeit
A books a thing soon written. Nay, indeed,
A born aristocrat, bred radical,
A brothers birthright, and no right of birth,
A but tuba.
A car, a man, a maraca.
A certain letter being destroyed. In fact,
A certain Rose, an early friend of hers,
A chief apostle; you would bear with you
A child like this, that smiles so in her face,
A child! what then? Suppose a neighbours sick
A child. Small business has a cast-away
A childs too costly for so mere a wretch;
A choking finger on her throat, last night,
A close mild mouth, a little soured about
A closer, tenderer presence of the soul,
A colour is the sign of a sick brain,
A contract carried boldly to the light,
A creature you had taken from the ground,
A Cyclops fingers could not strain to milk;
A dash of dawn-dew from the honeysuckle,
A dauntless Muse who eyes a dreadful Fate,
A dead snake, mind!and, turning round, replied,
A dog would never know me, Im so changed;
A dog! A panic in a pagoda.
A dog, a plan, a canal: pagoda.
A duchess fainted in a private box:
A duty. Virtue buds a dubious leaf
A face flashed like a cymbal on his face,
A fainter red, as if she watched a flame
A father, issuing from the misty roads
A fathered child, with fathers love and race
A feeling, you eradicate it,the acts
A few such cases, and, when strong, sometimes
A fine sight for a poet, sweet, like you,
A fine white snow-drift. Leave it there, your snow!
A finger-touch of God left whole on them;
A finished generation, dead of plague,
A flower beat with rain and wind,
A fold of rustling air, nor what they said
A fool will pass for such through one mistake,
A foolish fancywill it make you smile?
A former purpose. Yet my blush was flame,
A friend of his had reasons of her own
A friend! was I a friend? I see all clear.
A gap of silver laughter.
A garland which I startled thence one day
A gauntlet with a gift int. Every wish
A general concubinage expressed
A general insight into useful facts.
A generous cousin, was my cousin Vane.
A gentleman abstracted as myself
A ghost, and sighing like Didos. I came home
A gift from me, Aurora, without scorn?
A gift intended plainly for her heirs,
A glory from its being far;
A godlike nature his; the gods look down,
A golden applethough indeed, one day,
A great acacia, with its slender trunk
A great example,a true Genesis
A Greek king coming from a taken Troy,
A green thing from the garden in a cup,
A gross want, bread to fill it to the lips,
A gross want, food to fill us, and no more!
A gulph between us. I could yearn indeed,
A half truth? can I keep my own soul blind
A half-hour ere she died, or a half-year,
A half-length portrait, in a hanging cloak
A hand that can be clasp'd no more
A hand thrown back as mine is, into yours
A happy lover who has come
A harmless life, she called a virtuous life,
A hedgehog in the path, or a lame bird,
A hideous sight, a most indecent sight!
A hole to keep out vermin. Now, at last,
A holiday of miserable men
A hollow echo of my own,
A hollow form with empty hands.'
A Howard should know it. Then, I pressed him more
A huge, deserted, callow, black, bird Thing,
A human creature, must not, shall not flinch,
A hundred paces off? Even so direct,
A husband, said she. If the creature lied,
A kerchief left out all night in the rain,
A lad named E. Mandala
A lady called upon me on such a day.
A larger metaphysics might not help
A late-lost form that sleep reveals,
A Leigh had made a misalliance and blushed
A letter from me to Aurora Leigh,
A letter, ... as a man who drowns and gasps.
A letter, in the spelling of his mind?
A liberal landlord, graceful diner-out,
A like home, even. That you offer yours,
A little by his act perhaps, yet more
A little cold and dominant in love!
A little fretted by being called ‘young friend,
A little human hope of that or this,
A little less to Romney, were unjust,
A little longer! twould have hurt me much
A little money for his pressing debts ...
A little overgrown, I think there is
A little plainer. Did you hate me quite
A little side-door hanging on a hinge,
A little slowly, as a man in doubt,
A little sunburnt by the glare of life;
A little tenderly; so best, I say:
A living Cæsar would not dare to play
A look, a sigh, a touch upon the palm,
A looming bastion fringed with fire.
A lot not new I saw as I went on to L.A.
A love that burns through veils, will burn through masks,
A lover, not her husband.
A loving Psyche who loses sight of Love,
A mad dog which they had tortured. Up and down
A man like him is never overcome:
A man may love a woman perfectly,
A man may see the moon so, in a pond,
A man might walk a little ... but I!He loves
A man walked arm-linked with a lady veiled,
A man who wants instruction, mark me, not
A man, a plan, a canal: Panama.
A man, upon the outside of the earth,
A mans distraction must not cheat his soul
A mans mere ‘yes, a womans common ‘no,
A mans within me,let him act himself,
A marble finger dominant to ships,
A meek and manageable child. Why not?
A melancholy coast, and float up higher,
A melancholy smile, to catch myself
A mere bare blind stone in the blaze of day,
A mere dumb corpse, till Christ the Lord came down,
A mere itself,cup, column, or candlestick,
A mere religion,right to give, is all,
A mere, mere woman,a mere flaccid nerve,
A metre, as confounded as he had heard
A millers wife at Clichy took me in
A moment let me hold it, ere we part;
A moment, hope came,but the lady closed
A moment, it is very good for strength
A moment. Speak once, Romney. ‘Tis not true.
A moment? angry, that I could not bear
A month back, dear Aurora?
A month more from you! but I yield it up
A month passed so, and then the notice came;
A most unspotted Erle to a noble Leigh,
A motherly, unmerciful, good turn.
A mouse could find no sort of shelter int,
A murmur and a movement drew around;
A nail then pierced my foot: although my brain
A naked whisper touched us. Something wrong!
A name to! human, vital, fructuous rose,
A natural movement, therefore, on my part,
A neutral tint is here impossible.
A new order began, a more Roman age bred Rowena.
A new world all alive with creatures new,
A nose drawn sharply, yet in delicate lines;
A nut for a jar of tuna.
A pagan, kissing, for a step of Pan,
A pair of moistened eyes convicted mine.
A palimpsest, a prophets holograph
A Pallas in the Vatican;you mind
A paltry tune you never fairly liked,
A pattern lover sighing on his knee:
A perjury on, I make my mothers oath,
A pewter age,mixed metal, silver-washed;
A place for it beside me. The moon came,
A place to stand on is a vantage gained,
A poets only born to turn to use;
A poor spark snatched up from a failing lamp
A post of double-observation oer
A postscript stops all that, and rescues me.
A promontory without water, stretched,
A pure good mothers name and memory
A queen might stop at, near the palace-door,
A quiet ‘yes or ‘no, like English girls,
A quiet life, which was not life at all,
A ripple of land; such little hills, the sky
A Roman died so; smeared with honey, teased
A roof of grass on which a flower might spring,
A rose is pink and pretty without blood;
A rose upit falls calyx down, you see!...
A ruined creature.
A rustling bird, and now a wandering deer,
A Santa at Nasa.
A Santa dog lived as a devil God at NASA.
A sculptor puts his personal sadness in
A secret writing from a sombre page,
A serious riddle: find such anywhere
A sex, ah, ah, the man can generalise,
A sharp face, like a knife in a cleft stick,
A shore of pebbles bitten to one shape
A shot, ere half thy draught be done,
A sign of you, Miss Leigh.
A silver hair this morning from my beard,
A silver key is given to thy clasp,
A silver threepence sets them leaping high
A simple chance
A simple contract,he, upon his side,
A simple law-clause. If I married him,
A simple misalliance, got up aside
A simple shade or image of the brain,
A simple woman who believes in love,
A single blade of grass beneath these trees,
A single one,I saw it; otherwise
A single soul, a childs weight in a soul,
A sister of charity.
A slut nixes sex in Tulsa.
A small thing with a great thing, topping it!
A soil as red as Charlemagnes knightly blood,
A sort of cage-bird life, born in a cage,
A sort of smile to please him,as you place
A spacious lady, five feet ten and fat,
A spark into the night, half trodden out
A spinner in the mills. Alls yours and you,
A Spirit, not a breathing voice.
A spiritual life. The beautiful seems right
A star upon his stage of Eglinton!
A starved cat, if he had fed it once with milk,
A still Medusa, with mild milky brows
A still more intimate humanity
A stir among the leaves, a breath, a ray,
A stone can still give shelter to a worm,
A stone-dead father. Life, struck sharp on death,
A stranger with authority, not right,
A striking book, yet not a startling book,
A sunset from his favourite beech-tree seat:
A supposition, a potential love!
A sweet familiar nature, stealing in
A ten years birthday; twas so mad a thing
A tenderer name still. Had I any chance
A ten-years school-boy with a crooked stick
A terror out of sight. And yet to pause
A third is wroth: `Is this an hour
A Thomsons Seasons, mulcted of the Spring,
A thought enough to make a woman mad,
A thousand women have not larger eyes:
A three-years infant might say after you,
A time to sicken and to swoon,
A tin mug for a jar of gum, Nita.
A tiptoe Danae, overbold and hot;
A Toyota. Race fast, safe car. A Toyota.
A train of priestly banners, cross and psalm,
A trees mere firewood, unless humanised;
A use in measured language lies;
A very pretty poet! I can guess
A vine-leaf. The old porch had disappeared;
A visitor was ushered through the wards
A voice said, low and rapid as a sigh,
A void where heart on heart reposed;
A weary, wormy darkness, spurred i the flank
A web is wov'n across the sky;
A week hence,so I lose himso he is lost!
A weight of nerves without a mind,
A well-built wall,which stops you on the road,
A white face,shivering, ineffectual lips.
A whole life at each wound; incapable
A wicked man, I say, a wicked man!
A wicked murderer in my innocent face,
A wife ... a sister ... shall we speak it out?
A wife to help your ends ... in her no end!
A wife, I think, had scandals of her own,
A wigless Hamlet would have failed the same.
A wild bird scarcely fledged, was brought to her cage,
A will, which gives you all the personal goods
A wise man from wise courses, a good man
A witch, a poet, scholar, and the rest,
A woman ... not a monster ... both her breasts
A woman also, young and ignorant,
A woman cannot do the thing she ought,
A woman has been strangled with less weight:
A woman sauntered slow, in front,
A woman screamed back,‘Im a tender soul;
A woman stood between his soul and mine,
A woman takes a housewife from her breast,
A woman who does better than to love,
A woman who wants protection. As to a man,
A woman, not to be a man for once,
A woman,set her in the sight of all
A womans always younger than a man
A womans on the landing,‘How now, now!
A womans soul, like mans, be wide enough
A word, it shall be ‘no. I say no, no!
A yard of silk to carry out our lawn
A year back, ... since, in any doubt or dark,
ABBA 
Abeba
Abhorrent, admirable, beautiful,
Abiriba
Able was I ere I saw Elba
Abolished bounds,and, which my neighbours field,
About ... a friend, who once, long years ago,
About the plague that slew them; let me go.
About the prow, and back return
About your cousins place in Shropshire, where
Above all actual good or hope of good,
Above all want, approaching opulence,
Above book-patterns, which this very morn
Above his stature,‘am I proved too weak
Above the natural stature! we would play
Above the old roofs of Dijon. Lyons dropped
Above them,whirling downward from your heights
Above us, or below us, or around....
Abruptly the green silence of the woods,
Abruptly, as if frightened at itself;
Absorb the light here?not a hill or stone
Absorbed his soul, next moment. The good man!
Absorbed on nobler subjects. Hurt a fly!
Academician against poet, man
Acaiaca
Accept my reverence.
Accept the ends which God loves, for his own,
Accepting serfdom. Free men freely work:
Accomplished nothing ... well, it is not proved
According to being shone on more or less.
According to my pleasure and my choice,
According to the programme,and farewell!
Accounting that to leap from perch to perch
Accustomed many years to English speech;
Acrobats stab orca.
Across a street, in balcony or coach,
Across a waste of waters,shook her head
Across devouring waters, followed her,
Across devouring waters, step by step,
Across dim waters of a troubled life
Across his piercing eyes. Tis thus with you:
Across the bounds of time! heres nought to see,
Across the boys audacious front, and swept
Across the sliding water. ‘Certainly,
Across the theoretic flood from France,
Across the tingling Dark, while overhead
Across Valdarno, interposing still
Act out a rash opinion,and, once wed,

against
Against chance-vulgarisms, and, in the abyss,
Against disease and winter,snarling on
Against Gods separating judgment-hour.
Against him,the whole public,all the hoofs
Against his crystal dreams,that, now, hes strong
Against our just damnation. Stand aside;
Against such doings, and do otherwise.
Against that blue! What squares! what breathing-room
Against the broad vermilion of the skies.
Against the edges of this alien world,
Against the heels of what the master said;
Against the light, shell not see through it more
Against the lime-tree, and you will not look?
Against the place youve made them! let them look!
Against the sinful world which goes its rounds
Against the worlds successes, virtues, fames.
Against woman, against the living, the dead,

Alas! youll say, I speak and kill, instead.
Alas, a mother never is afraid
Alas, and woe to us, when we feel it most!
Alas, I still see something to be done,
Alas, if we could ride with naked souls
Alas, long-suffering and most patient God,
Alas, my Giottos background! the sheep run
Alas, the very sun forbids the dew.

all
All clanking at me, in me, over me,
All curdled and all clothed upon with snakes
All day and half the night, for him, and him?
All flying,ousted, like the House of Leigh.
All glittering with the dawn-dew, all erect
All glowing with the anticipated gold.
All grave and silent? mass-book still, and Lent?
All great arts, and all good philosophies,
All helping to keep up one blazing jest;
All like his books too, he has written books
All men are possible heroes: every age,
All modesty before them. Thus, today.
All night below the darken'd eyes;
All night no ruder air perplex
All night she had held it. If its news referred
All of you? am I wicked, do you think?
All other men declaring it well done;
All patterns of what shall be in the Mount;
All place and grace were forfeit in the house,
All pressed out, poured out upon Pimlico,
All privilege of Eden,making friends
All proceeds to me. Just a line to ask
All reddened, sweetened from one central Heart!
All ruined, lostthe countenance worn out
All signifying,‘Look you, Romney Leigh,
All silence, all the innocent breathing-points,
All the rest, he held her hand
All wealth, all lands, all social privilege,
All which I saved you, and absorb next week
All writing back.... ‘Sweet thanks, my sweetest friend,
All yours, in soul and body, in head and heart,
All, coloured with your blood, or otherwise
All, idealists
Alls past like youth; but just to witness here
Alls sad, the country struggling with the town,

although
Although he catches back, and says at last,
Although I lie here, Im alive as you,
Although Im clean. Ay, clean as Marian Erle:
Although it frankly ground the gravel here,
Although my fathers elder by a year
Although no stranger ... only Romney Leigh,
Although our woman-hands should shake and fail;
Although she could not love me.‘Say instead,
Although she should be spit upon of men,
Although she should not love him any more.
Although such trifles: children learn by such,
Although sufficient dull for twenty saints!
Although the world had jeered me properly
Although we scarcely die apostles, we,
Although you ask me for my cloak, Kate Ward!
Although you beat your head against itpshaw!
Although you have a vineyard in Champagne,
Although you thought to have shut a tedious book

among
Among familiar names to rest
Among his mountains. I was just thirteen,
Among his other paupers; change my sons,
Among our female authors we make room
Among the acacias of the shrubberies,
Among the acacias, over which, you saw
Among the breakers, some hard swimming through
Among the convalescents, like herself
Among the deep hills, as a hunted stag
Among the gallery portraits of our Leighs,
Among the giant fossils of my past,
Among the helpers, if theres any help
Among the lights and talkers at Lord Howes.
Among the mountain-peaks of Thessaly,
Among the mountains above Pelago;
Among the nosegays, cheapening this and that
Among the pushing people, ... to go ... where?
Among the turbulent masses, from the ground
Among the unspoken raptures. Yet more sick,
Among those mean red houses through the fog?

An active kind of curse. I stood there cursed
An age of mere transition, meaning nought,
An age of patches for old gaberdines;
An age of scum, spooned off the richer past;
An arrow shot into a man thats dead,
An artisans palm, or a peasants brow,
An artist, judge so?
An awful thought, a life removed,
An effort in their presence to speak truth:
An excellent landlord of the olden stamp,
An excellent subject when youre moderate;
An execrable marriage. Break it up,
An exorcism against the devildom
An honourable man, if somewhat rash;
An hour back, but the night had drawn her home;
An hour before the sun would let me read!
An hour long to you,I instruct you how
An hours time ... think!... to sit upon a bank
An inch-long swerving of the holy lines.
An orphan even of my fathers grave
An orphan. Come,and, henceforth, thou and I
An ounce of common, ugly, human dust,
An over-generous friend will care for me,
An overweight of justice toward the match;
An undowered orphan. Child, your fathers choice

And ‘enter there; the points for clapping, fixed,
And ‘Everywhere well prosper in our love,
And a sigh with it, but I felt her looks
And absent ... tender, when he thought of it,
And acts a play with it, as Hamlet did,
And added softly, ‘so, we shall not part.
And adds, he has an epic, in twelve parts,
And Ælian made mine wet. The trick of Greek
And after all, now, ... why should I be pained,
And after, over the whole stretch of land
And agonising with a ghastly sense
And all her faces light fell after him,
And all her wake-time quiet as a sleep;
And all my answer can be better said
And all my knowledge of myself;
And all my soul rose up to take her part
And all that night I thought.... ‘Good-night, said he.
And all that we would push him out of sight
And all the close-curled imagery clipped
And all the country people gave her pence
And all the dappled courtiers and court-fools,
And all the high necessities of Art,
And all the honour, well-assorted love,
And all the patient hills are bubbling round
'And all the phantom, Nature, stands
And all the place is dark, and all
And all the presentations of the stars
And all the secret of the Spring
And all the silvery gossamers
And all the starry turbulence of worlds
And all the various stairs that took you up
And all the youth-blood in them had grown white
And all their hoggery trample your smooth world,
And all these peoples.
And all three of us, at to-morrows break,
And all true poets laugh unquenchably
And all unworthy so much compliment.
And all was good that Time could bring,
And all we met was fair and good,
And all with cares and business of their own!
And all you might have been to me these years,
And also after it was well asleep,
And also, to do good is excellent,
And altogether tolerable, except
And am alone from henceforth.Then I stooped,
And ankle-deep in English grass I leaped,
And ape a Bourbon in a crown of straws;
And apparitional equal care for each,
And are potatoes to grow mythical
And are you happy with the ilex-leaves?
And are you ready for the crochet here?
And argued, struggled upon Marians side,
And art. You swim with feet as well as hands,
And as I entered, an ineffable face
And ask a thousand things of home;
And ask for what a woman cannot give?
And asked her, ‘Marian, carry out my child
And asked if peradventure she could read;
And bade him mark that, howsoeer the world
And bade me mark how we two met at last
And balmy drops in summer dark
And bar for ever mutual sight and touch
And be a worthier mate, perhaps, than some
And be of use! twere cheaper for your youth.
And be possessed by none of them! no right
And beardless Byron academical,
And beat her taper foot upon the floor,
And beauty keeps itself still uppermost,
And beckoning unto those they know;
And bent it in the garden,then looked up
And best, for her, at this time.
And better all things. Did she dream for nought,
And better sotis shorter seen than told.
And bids us diet on the dew inside,
And bids us go up higher. Leave us, then;
And bind him.
And bit them slow between my absent lips,
And black bread eaten by the road-side hedge
And bless thy ministration. The world waits
And blossom wheresoeer a hand divine
And blow about my feelings, or my leaves,
And blow all class-walls level as Jerichos
And blow that great top attic off his head
And blow their bad breath in a sisters face
And bore me tongue-tied. If youll grant me now
And bore thee where I could not see
And both in earnest. Men and women make
And both in torments; with a mediate gulph,
And both worlds have Gods providence, thank God,
And both, commended, for the sake of each,
And brag your failings as mankinds. Be still.
And break a stalk, perhaps, tormenting me;
And break your heart upont ... hell scarce be touched;
And break your tulips, bite your tender trees:
And breaking into sobs cried, ‘Where I go?
And breasts upturned and straining, the loose locks
And breathe the fine keen breath along the brass,
And bring the firstling to the flock;
And bring the uneven world back to its round;
And broke in, ‘Henceforth she was called his wife.
And bruised from what she was,changed! deaths a change,
And bruit against Him that his thought is void,
And built up to eterne significance
And bullies God,exacts a word at least
And burn the lights of love before thy face,
And burn us up to quiet! Ah, we know
And bury all my Dead like Alaric,
And bury her in silence! ring no bells.
And but for fancies, which aver
And but for fear it is not so,
And buying many a two-inch-wide rush-cage
And by the child, my Marian, by the child,
And by the grief, reproach, abandonment,
And calculating profits ... so much help
And call it mounting higher, because we grow
And call it self-defence because we are soft.
And call their fancies by the name of facts,
And calls my name ... ‘Alola, stripping off
And calm with abdication. She is Jove,
And Camelot to minstrels seemed as flat,
And can play on at leisure, being adored:
And cannot choose be satisfied so soon
And captious, lest it miss my dignity,
And catch a fly. Im happy. Its sublime,
And catch the mattock up.
And catch up with it any kind of work,
And cattle grazing in the watered vales,
And certain brides of Europe duly ask
And certain to be called so presently
And certainly a few clapped hands and yelled
And certainly I should be livelier still
And certainly I would not fail so much.
And certify that date to you.
And changed it therefore. Theres no marriagenone.
And changes the first form of it. Ive marked
And cheat myself of the context,I should push
And chiefly when the sun shines, that Ive failed.
And children cannot wander beyond reach
And childrens;babies, hanging like a rag
And chink to her naughty uses undisturbed,
And choke us in the melancholy Deep,
And choose the headsmans! May God change his world
And chose my words with scrupleslowly stepped
And circle moaning in the air:
And civic, ... all fair petals, all good scents,
And claims an epos.
And clapped my hands, and called all very fair.
And clearly as those said three hundred pounds
And climbed to it. I think he looks well now,
And coldly chooses empire, where as well
And come back to the stone without the dream,
And come, whatever loves to weep,
And comes back ever.
And comfort grief with grief. For you, meantime,
And common critics, ordinarily deaf
And common is the commonplace,
And compliments on writing our good books.
And comprehend me that I loved you so,
And comprehension of what love is,love,
And Comte is dwarfed,and Cabet, puerile.
And cool your angry forehead. She, at least,
And correspondence, to that spirit-world
And cottage-chimneys smoking from the woods,
And cottage-gardens smelling everywhere,
And counted grains, like any salaried nurse,
And counterfeiting epics, shrill with trumps
And courtesy of manners. Delicate drinks
And cousin Romney well,and I well too,
And crash it out with clangour. I was weak;
And cried, ‘God save me if theres any God,
And crisis of the ages. Heres an age,
And cross the quotient. There are many, even,
And crossed by his sensations. Presently
And crosses out the spontaneities
And crosswise, till it fluttered from my hands,
And crowded farms and lessening towers,
And crowed and gurgled through his infant laugh:
And crush that beetle in the leaves.
And crush thee,better cover thy bald head;
And crying, How changed from where it ran
And cursed his wife because, the pence being out,
And cursed me for my tyrannous constraint
And cursed you for the little good it did,
And cut me off from music.
And daily papers; Spanish marriage-schemes,
And damned the general world for standing up.
And dared to do it, they were so far off
And dash his brute front unabashed against
And dash this last page? What he said, indeed,
And daub their natural faces unaware
And daylight duties. She could creep about
And dead calm in that noble breast
And dearly honoured ... he pressed in at once
And dearly she would know it ... steal a thought
And Delia Dobbs, the lecturer from ‘the States
And did I pray, a half hour back, but so,
And die into the chrysalis of a man,
And die upon the falls of it. O love,
And died, not young,the life of a long life,
And distant things, as intimately deep,
And do as vile a thing as if you ate
And do not muffle it in a winter-cloak
And do not too much hurt me. Marians good,
And do their kingly work,conceive, command,
And do you love me who have let you go?
And does not thunder, ... whom at last I left,
And drawing from his countenance to hers
And draws us backward from the coarse town-sights
And dream, if possible, I am not cross.
And drew blood from him, but I sobbed for it
And drew her drenched and passive, by the arm,
And drew her probing and unscrupulous eyes
And drew me feebly through the hall, into
And drop before the wonder oft; you miss
And drop it, ... to do even so by thee
And dropped her eyes on me, and let them melt.
And dropped my head upon the pavement too,
And dropped upon his lips, a cold dead weight,
And dropping her impassioned spaniel head
And dropping on me from his high-eaved brow
And drops an accent or digamma down
And dropt upon me. Surely I should be glad.
And drowning in the transport of the sight,
And drowns him,and that, lavishing her soul,
And dry out from my drowned anatomy
And dull and vague. Did Shakspeare and his mates
And dull the sound oft. For myself, be sure,
And dull'd the murmur on thy lip,
And dust the flaunty carpets of the world
And dying off smothered in the shuddering dark,
And ease my breath a little, when none looked;
And easier served; for where the man discerns
And easily explored. She had the means,
And educated socialist, who still
And elegiac griefs, and songs of love,
And elsewhere, come to nought then?
And emulous of their hues: I recognised
And end by letting slip through impotence
And end,‘Now give us the beasts part, in death.
And English climatewast so cold last year?
And English women, she thanked God and sighed,
And entertainer more than hospitable,
And even his very body as a man,
And even that stuff of ‘fields of gold, ‘gold rings,
And even their odds. A man may well despair,
And even voice, and gorgeous eyeballs, calm
And ever at thy sweet look cross myself
And ever met him on his way
And every common bush afire with God:
And every heart-beat down there in the bill,
And every light made sorrow clearer ... Well,
And every time she brought with her more light,
And every woman catch your mothers face
And everybody stood, all eyes and ears,
And eyes that, when they look on you, will lean
And eyes undried because theres none to ask
And failed, and lifted higher above his head
And fain would enter, when their time shall come,
And fain would know the end of everything,
And famished for the morning,saying, while
And Fancy light from Fancy caught,
And farewell. Ah, you dog-eared such a page,
And fasten, kneeling, on her regent brows
And fastening it behind so, ... turning faced
And fatten household sinners,their, in brief,
And fears and admirations; was by turns
And fears, joys, grieves, and loves?with all that strain
And fed at evening with the blood of suns;
And feel by millions! What, if even God
And feels out blind at first, disorganised
And felt the country through from end to end;
And fetched back to the necessary day
And feuds of earth, intestine heats have made
And fevered him with dreams of doing good
And fierce in expectation,I, who felt
And fifty praises to excuse one love
And fill those vases, ere Im quite awake,
And find a sea-king with a voice of waves,
And find in autumn, when the friend is gone,
And find in loss a gain to match?
And fingers it for ever till it breaks,
And first-communion colours on your cheeks,
And fix it in the hard, slow-turning wards,
And flare up bodily, wings and all. What then?
And flash familiarly about your feet
And flashes into false and true,
And fled on southward in the roar of steam.
And floated from me like a silent cloud
And flooded all the city, which you saw
And fluttering, like dumb creatures before storms,
And fly off to be angry with the world,
And fly, because I dare not.
And followed that bad guide. The lady?hush,
And fools upon one string of a mans name,
And for this short night only,you, who keep
And forced to take an iceberg for an isle!
And form insensuous, that inferior men
And forward dart again, and play
And forward madly fled, or blindly fell,
And found no blood upon the rapiers point;
And found thee lying in the port;
And fright you, hurt you with my tempers, till
And from his ashes may be made
And full protection,‘would commit me straight
And fumbling vainly therefore at the lock
And funded monies of your aunt.
And gain you! You will come and see the girl,
And gather up my feet from even a step,
And gave me such a smile, so cold and bright,
And gave my name to swell subscription-lists
And gaze across them, half in terror, half
And gazing on thee, sullen tree,
And gentle, it will leap upon the beds
And German also, since she liked a range
And get not over-early solemnised,
And get the thanks of men for hopeful books;
And ghastly thro' the drizzling rain
And give it time and strength for feeling out
And give offence by the act of springing up;
And glad at heart from May to May:
And glad to find thyself so fair,
And gladly too. Tis pretty, to remark
And glance about the approaching sails,
And glare unnatural; the very sky
And glide along the churchyard like a bride,
And go to church to own it. What I meant,
And God alone above each,as the sun
And God alone pleased,thats too poor, we think,
And God, who knows it, looks for quick returns
And goest where thou wouldest: presently
And gone away where none can give or take
And good for God Himself, the essential Good!
And good with drawbacks. You, you love your art,
And good, good mothers, who would use a child
And goodness, and hath power to see
And gradually a ripple of womens talk
And grind to devilish colours all your dreams
And groped her out, and clasped her with a kiss;
And grow incorporate into thee.
And grow the grimy colour of the ground
And grown domestic like a barn-door fowl,
And had his heart danced over in return;
And had my friend,for Nature comes sometimes
And had no beard to bristle through her song,
And had the customs of the world, intent
And had the right to counsel,‘My young friend,
And hair in masses, low upon the brow,
And half a water,that I leaned and looked;
And half conceal the Soul within.
And hands so often clasp'd in mine,
And happier, less known and less left alone;
And happy children, having caught up first
And has no answer? What! a happier child
And hastening to get nearer to the sun,
And hate the stall built for you? Any way,
And hate the unreasoning awe which waves them off
And hated, with the gall of gentle souls,
And have mislaid the keys of heaven and earth.
And have no heavenly lordship in our stare
And he ... my cousin Romney ... did not write.
And He alone who wields the hammer, sees
And he born tender, made intelligent,
And he feels out for virtue.
And He has said so often through his nights
And he not ill.
And he should sorrow o'er my state
And hes a dismal orphan ... not a son;
And heaped up to a system.
And hear Assuntas daily jest she knew
And hear him call her good?
And hear the cymbal tinkle in white hands?
And hear the nations praising them far off,
And hear the ritual of the dead.
And hear the silence open like a flower,
And hear the streams bleat on among the hills
And heard half absently the women talk,
And heard them whisper, when I changed a cup,
And heart come bleeding,sure, that he and I
And heavy with my grief, my two poor eyes
And Hectors infant blubbered at a plume
And held a letter with unbroken seal,
And held your trailing lutestring up yourself
And help the work of help which was his life,
And help to dim the daylight. Ah, mans pride
And henceforth one with our humanity,
And henceforth step down lower, stand confessed
And her incisive smile, accrediting
And here I reach you to forgive you, sweet,
And here Im come to see my cousin too.
And here is ended my pretension which
And here upon my level we take hands,
And here you find me.
And here, well talk of stars, and not of books.
And heres my aunt will help you with east winds,
And heres the face come back you used to like.
And heres the point we come to.
And heres the secret of a hundred creeds,
And heres your tripod. To be plain, dear friend,
And hers, Aurora. Small amends theyll make
And high-born ladies, waited for the bride.
And hoarse with rapture of the summer-heat,
And holding her with eyes that would not slip;
And holds the fiefs and manors in his place,
And hollow of my soul, which opens out
And hollowed out his hands to hold your cheeks,
And honest, and inclined to do the right,
And honour us with truth, if not with praise.
And hope, now for me, now against me, dragged
And how by mounting aye, we must attain,
And how God laughs in heaven when any man
And how my life had droop'd of late,
And how the strange confession of your love
And how we should be uneasy in our minds,
And how we smiled when such a vehement nail
And how your white dress and your burnished curls
And how, in choosing sin, we vexed the Christ,
And humbled sorely if not enough. I came,
And humour in stage-tricks; or else indeed
And hurrying lips, and heaving heart! We are young
And hush'd my deepest grief of all,
And hushes half the babbling Wye,
And I a woman; feebly, partially,
And I a woman?
And I am sad:
And I breathe large at home. I drop my cloak,
And I can speak a little then.
And I could be a mother in a month!
And I had enough to think of what to do
And I must make it straightway, head and point,
And I not asked as much as, ‘Whats the thing
And I not ignorantlet it pass. And now,
And I perceived no touch of change,
And I refused him?
And I should tell him all my pain,
And I stood still, and cold, and pale, I think,
And I went down unto the quay,
And I who have written much in prose and verse
And I who said so, did but honour you
And I will carve the world new after it,
And I will pay thee with a current coin
And I, a man, as men are now, and not
And I, as Im a man who honours God,
And I, at least, have not deserved it so
And I, I had come back to an empty nest,
And I, I was a good child on the whole,
And I, incapable to loose the knot
And I, instinctively, as women use
And I, so young then, was not sullen. Soon
And I, still ignorant. Shut the book up! close!
And I, too, ... God has made me,Ive a heart
And I, who do not love him, nor love you,
And I, who fled from her for miles and miles,
And I, who spoke the truth then, stand upright,
And Ill be a true wife to your cousin Leigh.
And Ill be bound by only you, in this.
And Ill be just and pay them.
And Im well pleased. Ah, cousin! at the old hall,
And if tis eer so little like the god
And if twere likely hed remember hers,
And if a man should cry, ‘I want a pin,
And if along with these should come
And if by chance he might be warmer housed
And if he laughed, as many swear, poor wretch,
And if he takes a Venus Meretrix,
And if I fail ... why, burn me up my straw
And if I had been a fathom less in love,
And if I had not promised Mistress Grove ...
And if I lie so, ... if, being fouled in will
And if Im boldyet, lady, credit me,
And if it must be in heaven instead of earth,
And if that eye which watches guilt
And if the Iliad fell out, as he says,
And if we fail.... But must we?
And if we stand not by our order, we
And if you seek for any wilderness
And if you weep still, weep where John was laid
And if your book shall sell as his did, then
And if, since then, Ive writ a book or two,
And if, to save the child from death as well,
And Imy poem;let my readers talk;
And in all nature is no death at all,
And in my heart, if calm at all,
And in the dusk of thee, the clock
And in the hearing of the wave.
And in the places of his youth.
And in this twofold sphere the twofold man
And in thy wisdom make me wise.
And individual right no general wrong;
And insects,which look fathered by the flowers
And intense verdure, yet find room enough
And interchange the common talk of life
And interlined the golden atmosphere
And is a woman to be fooled aside
And is instead, a place to curse by! Love.
And is it that the haze of grief
And is no despot, though twice absolute;
And it is worth while being a stone for that:
And it shall ‘please me, in your words, to know
And John,I never sent my plate for soup,
And Julie waiting for your betters here?
And just a clever tale to keep us still,
And juster than I have found you!
And keep his clean.
And keep it stainless from her mothers face,
And keep it,it shall pay you for the loss,
And keep me happier ... was the thing to say, ...
And keep me happy ... happier....
And keep my birthday, till my aunt awoke
And keep my wits. The town, there, seems to seethe
And keeps the scythes glow on it. Pray you, then,
And kept her safe meantime from tampering hands,
And kept in long-clothes past the age to walk.
And kept upon the height and in the light,
And kept you open-eyed to all my faults,
And kissed her hair and eyes,‘I have been wrong,
And kissed poor Marian, out of discontent.
And kissing full sense into empty words;
And knew he had no father. It may be,
And knew, the first time, twas Boccaccios tales,
And know by such a look, or such a sigh,
And know I cannot win a look of yours.
And know that, when indeed our Joves come down,
And knowing they should, some day, weep again.
And knows it, holding by a hand he loves.
And Lady Waldemar saw less than I,
And laid her by her grandmother in bed,
And laid her in his waggon in the straw,
And last, twas sure ...
And Latin, he had taught me, as he would
And laughed with such a helpless, hopeless scorn,
And lavished stitches on a ladys hem
And lays his last books prodigal review
And lean my heaviest oath on when I swear
And lean the side you please, with all your leaves!
And leant her head upon the back to cough
And learn to reverence, even this poor myself.
And learn what good is by its opposite
And learns her gone and far from home;
And learnt the thing by heart,and, from my heart,
And leave me breath enough to speak with him,
And leave one green, for men to play at bowls,
And leave the best that may, to come of us,
And leave the cliffs, and haste away
And leave the generous flames to shape themselves.
And leave to sleep in straw: and twice they tied,
And leaves king Saul precisely at the sin,
And leaves you with Plotinus. None of these,
And left him dubious if twas really I,
And left him.
And left me ruined like it, stripped of all
And left me what I am. The curtain dropped,
And left these fragments.
And left, perhaps, for my sake.Ah, self-tied
And let it draw me. You have shown me truths,
And let it mind her of a certain friend,
And let it stop you as a generous man
And let me dream a moment how it feels
And let me sew in peace among her girls;
And let me watch the garland in a place,
And let my word be sweeter for your mouth,
And let the mice out slily from his traps,
And let this letter break off innocent
And let you feel I am not so high indeed,
And lets it in at once: the train swept in
And letters unto trembling hands;
And letting drop the white wax as they went
And lifes relations, wedlock, not the least;
And lifes transitions down the steps of law.
And lift a constant aspect.
And lifted the soiled garland from the ground,
And lifting up the child at full arms length,
And light, not sunlight and not torchlight, flashed
And like a beacon guards thee home.
And like a guilty thing I creep
And like it somehow.Ah, the old Tuileries
And liked it; ‘all to-night Ive strained at you,
And liked to mingle with the out-door crowd
And linger weeping on the marge,
And listened probably to half her talk,
And listened through the stars for Italy.
And live for use. Alas, near all the birds
And live on stoutly, as the creatures will
And live together in phalansteries.
And lived before him, lived, and rarely smiled,
And lived my life, and thought my thoughts, and prayed
And lived to know. Herein is argument
And lively, like his father! one was keen
And lives fail. Do I feel it so, at last?
And lizards, the green lightnings of the wall,
And loathed for ever after by the good.
And look at othersinstance little Kate!
And look the better for being so much worse:
And look, and so impress you with the word?
And looked at one another. Then I said,
And looked before and after, as I stood
And looked up piteous in the mothers face,
And looking back to whence I came,
And lose it, lose ourselves too in the search;
And lose that certain candle, straight and white
And lose your natural instinct, like a beast,
And Love strikes higher with his lambent flame
And Love the indifference to be,
And love the truth, and live my life out green
And love you on for ever. Now I know
And Love, the soul of soul, within the soul,
And loved like ... some ... ay, loved you, Romney Leigh,
And loved my mortal? He, at least, loved her;
And loves him ... as the sort of woman can.
And loyally Ive promised she shall say
And made a nobler poem for the world
And made a nosegay of the sweet and good
And made all silent,while the peoples smoke
And made him mad, alike by life and death,
And made it less substantial. And I knew
And made me that delirious man
And made the blue air wink. The waxen mask,
And made the forest-rivers garrulous
And made the living answer for the dead,
And madly scouring up and down for weeks
And make a game oft; ‘Oh, we generalise
And make his drink more costly by our pearls.
And make it stranger, holier, more profound;
And make no noise and pay no price at all,
And make the silence shiver: they sound strange,
And make them pipes whereon to blow.
And make you poor by getting richthats law;
And makes a silence in the hills.
And makes a sort of badness; theres the worst
And makes heaven. I, Aurora, fell from mine:
And makes it better sometimes than itself.
And makes us part as those at Babel did,
And manias usual to the race. Howbeit
And manly. For myself,now mark me, sir,
And many a flower of London gossipry
And many an old philosophy
And many patient souls neath English roofs
And Marian what you know her,though a wife,
And mark how pale weve grown, we pitiful
And mark what subtly fine integument
And marriage-law dissolved,in plainer words,
And marriage-laws ... the socket drops them through
And married harlot. Speak, while yet theres time:
And marry, or not marry. Henceforth, none
And marvel what possess'd my brain;
And me and no one else....
And me, of course. He had not asked me else
And me. I know Im foolish, weak, and vain;
And mediæval ‘Look that way, Sir Blaise.
And melt like white pearls in anothers wine,
And melt the waxen hearts of men.'
And melts at the first touch of the green grass.
And memories of what, present once, was loathed.
And memory; let it be,a poets heart
And men may well come hither when theyre sick,
And men who work, can only work for men,
And mend its rents a little. Oh, to storm
And merely very reasonably sad.
And merry books, which set you weeping when
And mildewed wall that let the plaster drop
And milked the cows, and churned, and pressed the curd,
And mine, I thank the saints, is clear and cool:
And mine, Ill say!For poets bear the word
And mine.
And mingles all without a plan?
And miss the glory ...
And missed it rather,told me not to shrink,
And mock you from the windows. You might say,
And more puissant. For the wicked there
And mores perceived than can be interpreted,
And most for that sweet thrice you kissed my lips
And most prosaic patience. You, you are young
And mother-hushes, ere she saw him sound.
And motioned to a chair; but down he sate,
And Mount Morello and the setting sun,
And mournfully I lived. I knew the birds
And moves his doubtful arms, and feels
And murmurs from the dying sun:
And my poor fathers melancholy eyes
And need one flannel, with a proper sense
And needs no mediate poet, lute or voice,
And nestle into, with those soft-winged eyes
And never committed felony?
And never flinched. ‘The dear Christ comfort you,
And never say ‘no when the world says ‘ay,
And never scold nor beat us! dont you wish
And never since was easy with the world.
And never spoke before to arraign my right
And nightmare of the mountains. Out, at last,
And no more Chianti! Still the letters use
And no more Danaegreater thus. Perhaps
And no more use,through this worlds underground
And no third troubling.
And Noahs wine; clay by handfuls, clay by lumps,
And none can stand a-tiptoe in the place
And none of these is more unscrupulous
And none shall vex us. Ive a home for you
And none was left to love in all the world.
And not a failure, this time. Let us grant
And not a fancy, though it vanished so;
And not afraid of judgment. Now, theres space
And not allow for puckerings in the silks
And not as Marian.
And not as wisely, since less foolishly;
And not be nearer therefore to the moon,
And not be thrown out by the matins bell
And not being overnice to separate
And not embody. Inward evermore
And not enough for us, by any means.
And not for Romney: he can stand alone;
And not for your sake only, but mankinds.
And not from man, O Lord, to thee.
And not from poets. ‘Leave my Job, said God;
And not of virtue. Yet in one respect,
And not so honest. Ay, and, as I live,
And not speak, after the great news I heard
And not the burthen that they bring.
And not throw back an obolus inscribed
And not with fools exclusively. And so,
And note the secret of Da Vincis drains,
And nothing in the world comes single to him,
And nothing should surprise us any more,
And noticeably narrow: a strong wind,
And now tis night.
And now a screen of carven ivory
And now for peace, a little! Let me stop
And now his son who represents our house
And now I come, my Italy,
And now I know He held you in his palm,
And now Ill loose my heart upon a page,
And now Im sadder that I went to-night
And now the baker says, who took her up
And now the rest?
And now well make the rest as clear; your aunt
And now you shall not cast me off because
And now, be patient with me; do not think
And now, its night, remember; we have shades
And now, my Italy.
And now, she thinks Ill get up from my grave,
And obviously deserve it. He appealed
And oft the jangling influence jarred the child
And oh, as truly as that was Marians face,
And old Assunta to make up the fire,
And old, my cousin Romney. Pardon me,
And olive-gardens with his tyrannous tusks,
And on these dews that drench the furze,
And once the sea, that blue end of the world,
And once went farther and saw Manchester,
And once you vexed me. Shall we speak of that?
And one is glad; her note is gay,
And one is sad; her note is changed,
And one was proud ... ‘and if her sweetheart Luke
And one was tender for her dear goodman
And only listen to the run and beat
And only miss your cousin; tis not much!
And only once, at the Santissima,
And only thro' the faded leaf
And only waited for their falling back,
And onward drags a labouring breast,
And open on each other your great souls,
And open pastures, where you scarcely tell
And open, so, that intermediate door
And opens up his wonderful blue eyes:
And orb into the perfect star
And ordered, built the cards up high and higher,
And other fevers, in the vulgar way.
And other light work done for thrifty wives.
And other possible ends. All things I did,
And other practical stuff of partial good,
And ought to find it possible to speak
And our most mortal presence,gradually
And out of nature. ‘Lady Waldemar,
And out of reach of these poor womans arms,
And out of saving? lost in every sense?
And out-door sights sweep gradual gospels in,
And outside ... dogs.
And overflowed the world and swamped the light,
And overlived in this close London life!
And overpoise of multitudinous leaves,
And overwashed you with the bitter brine
And own this good, true, noble Marian, ... yours,
And owns the right of love because she loves,
And packing such things quite another way,
And palpitated forth upon the wind,
And paltered with in soul by devils lust,
And Pans white goats, with udders warm and full
And part it, giving half to him.
And passed alone I carried on, and set
And passion of the course. And when, at last
And patching petticoats from old to new,
And pats all even. Need we wait for this,
And paused among the talkers. ‘When he looked,
And paused upon his flank. The houses front
And peeled a new fig from that purple heap
And peradventure weakyou tell me so
And perfect heroism without a scratch.
And perfect virtue dealt out like the rest,
And pick them up? tis written in the Book,
And pieced them with her strong benevolence;
And pierce your breast through Romneys, I who live
And pine and die, because of the great sum
And pines for waters.
And piously of His person. We blaspheme
And pipe but as the linnets sing:
And plaintive wail of vespers, where a few,
And plants you in her hair!possess, yourself,
And pleasure-barges, full of silks and songs.
And plucks the delicatest needle out
And plunged into the dark, and groped and climbed
And poacher, whom I found for what he was,
And poets evermore are scant of gold,
And poets get directlier at the soul,
And ponder where theyd dance the next time, they
And potash, trying potentialities
And poverty proves, plainly, special grace.
And praise your book aright: Fames smallest trump
And prayed your words out. Why, a beast, a dog,
And prayed, ‘no more of that. A waggoner
And prayed, since I was foolish in desire
And prays, perhaps, another! After all,
And pretty dresses, silk the whole year round ...
And pretty enough, so please you, and rich enough,
And pride of all your lofty race of Leighs
And privilege of seeing....
And promised a pearl troth-ring for the next
And promised, as my guerdon, to put off
And prove he kept back nothing,not his soul.
And prove to Romney, in your brilliant way,
And proved he need not rest so early:then,
And proved I had never trodden such a road,
And proved I took some trouble for his sake
And Psyche made one marble by a kiss
And pulling thoughts to pieces leisurely,
And pure, with such a pair of large, calm eyes, ...
And purple water: I think Marian slept;
And push his innocent smile against the guns?
And push my needles down, and lead me out
And pushing him with empyreal disdain
And put us down by putting up the lip,
And puts on May-fair manners, so begins
And questioned it for that. For she, my aunt,
And quiet hearing. You know Eglinton,
And quiet people walking in and out
And quiet so and fortify his brain
And quotes you up against me till Im pushed
And raise mens bodies still by raising souls,
And rare white bread, to which some dying eyes
And ratify from his authentic mouth
And raze all personal cloisters of the soul
And reach the glow of southern skies,
And read it softly, Lady Waldemar,
And ready to pull down upon our heads
And really: where we yearn to lose ourselves
And reconciled and fraternised my soul
And Regan with her sister Goneril
And resolute to get me, slow and sure;
And rest there: she must prove what she can do
And rest upon the dusty roadside bank
And restless for the countrys virtue, yet
And restless, so ambitious, for his part,
And reverence fish and fowl, the bull, the tree,
And rich men make the poor, who curse the rich,
And riddled them in ashes through a sieve
And risen self-crowned in rainbow: would she ask
And risk to spoil it half an hour before
And roar from yonder dropping day:
And roar of oaths, and blows perhaps ... I passed
And rolling on our maize with all his swine,
And Romney sought her many days and weeks:
And Romneys marriage-vow, ‘Ill keep to thee,
And Roses pelting glee, as frank as rain
And rosebuds reddening where the calyx split.
And roughs with scale and knob, before it strikes
And round us all the thicket rang
And running knots in eyebrows! You must have
And rush with most unscrupulous logic on
And rushed on,forward, forward ... after her.
And sacrificial greatness. Ay, but he
And sad, to use such lofty scaffoldings,
And said ‘Dear Marian.
And said ‘my sister to the lowest drab
And said to me, to me too, ‘Be my wife,
And said, ‘I am his cousin,Romney Leighs;
And said, ‘Well live, Aurora! well be strong.
And said, ‘You work too much, you are looking ill,
And sate upon the bedside with the child.
And save her, if she will or will notchild
And save him from a devils company!
And save the tiring of your eyes, at night;
And saw no need for choosing. Moths will burn
And say Leigh Hell, and burn it up with fire.
And say, ‘Come down to Romneypay my debt!
And say, ‘Fie, pale-face! are you English girls
And say, ‘My fellow-worker, be my wife!
And say, ‘Now give me some of Romneys work,
And say,‘This world here is intolerable;
And saying themselves for ever oer my acts
And saying; `Comes he thus, my friend?
And says the word so that it burns you through
And says, ‘I am ambassador for God.
And says, ‘I dropped the coin there: take it, you,
And says, ‘my child. Wholl find an emerald ring
And scarce endure to draw the breath,
And scared a sickly husbandwhat of that?
And scarlet berries; or like any man
And scorch and seethe itself to a finer mood,
And scorn than hatred. I am used, since then,
And scornful, that my lover sought a wife
And seal, and now Im out of all the coil;
And see the sails at distance rise,
And seen you sitting, standing, still at watch.
And self-absorbed conception, and exact
And sent me a copy bound in scarlet silk,
And set her own love digging her own grave
And set him up as nine-pin in their talk,
And set it on my head as bitterly
And set me in the Olympian roar and round
And set me wandering in the garden-walks,
And set my barking, biting thoughts upont.
And set such pure amens to hideous deeds?
And set the country hounds upon my back
And set the grains a-sprouting. What, youre green
And set thee there, my saint, the child and thee,
And set them on the wall in some safe shade,
And several after: Romney did not come,
And shake at pleasure,nor conclude at yours,
And shall I take a thing so blind,
And shall we put Him down by aught we do?
And shaped to dubious order, word and act:
And share the luck. So, bless you, friend of two!
And she accept it without detriment
And she loved him, she might say, now the chance
And she shall not drop through into a trap
And she was there to meet me. Very kind.
And she, herself,and clung to him as if
And she, I said, was murdered; Marians dead.
And she, not even for Romney, would she spill
And she, she almost loved him,even allowed
And shift its morals. If a man could feel,
And shock he gave my life, in finding me
And shook a half-hour after. Have you learnt
And shook for cold. But now I understood
And shook her head, as white and calm as frost
And shook his nails in anger, and came down
And shook my pulses and the elms new leaves,
And shook with silent clangour brain and heart,
And shot through tunnels, like a lightning-wedge
And should I sit down to the crochet work?
And show our Romney wounded, ill-content,
And show us how a man was made to walk!
And showed sometimes the goitre in his throat
And shred them with my hands....
And shriek, ‘What help? what hope? what bread i the house,
And shrivel up treachery. What, love and lie!
And shrunk before that clause in the entail
And shudder through its passages and stairs
And shut his dog out.
And shut it like the holy book it is,
And shut the rest out with the chamber-door,
And sighed for joy: or else I thank your friend
And sighed my soul out. The most utter wretch
And sighing was his gift. So, undisturbed
And signifies a multiform of death,
And signs, ‘Elisha to you. Pringle Sharpe
And simply, he returned, ‘as God does all;
And simultaneous shiver of moiré silk;
And sin too!... does one woman of you all,
And sink the need of acorns. Government,
And sinned against him so, but only so.
And sit down here beside you, in good hope.
And sit upon a long bench in a row
And sleep on down, if needs, for sleep on straw;
And sleep, and dream of something we are not,
And slowly forms the firmer mind,
And slowly, through the interior wheels of each,
And slumber snatched at noon, was long sometimes
And smell the flowers a little, and see the sun,
And smile a little, Marian,for the child,
And smile into the hedges and the clouds,
And smile?Nay, not so much as when, in heat,
And smiled against the shoe,‘Youre hard, Miss Leigh,
And smiled with thirsty lips before I drank,
And smiled, as if her smile could help my case,
And smooth beneath his steps, I should not fear
And snatching, in a sort of breathless rage,
And so accepted ... if accepted ... ah,
And so be mild, Aurora, with my worst,
And so climb on. It is the hour for souls;
And so conveyed her to the distant town
And so devoured. From end to end, the church
And so fail twice. Be sure, no earnest work
And so forsake me as I let him feel
And so he spake. His breath against my face
And so I am strong to love this noble France,
And so I answered. Till Lord Howe broke in;
And so I forced my heart back from the sight;
And so I know, by this time, God lives too.
And so I lived for him, and so he lives,
And so I lived: the weeks passed on,I lived.
And so I offered to come straight to you,
And so I warn you. Im ... Aurora Leigh.
And so Ive kept for ever in his sight
And so improve it to a garden-pink,
And so in silence we walked on a mile.
And so much love, accord, for so much love,
And so my mothers lost, tis manifest.
And so on, in the scholars regal way
And so on. As for Romney Leigh, tis sure
And so on. Then a worthless gaud or two,
And so passed Marians life from year to year.
And so possess the whole man, body and soul.
And so recovered what I called myself,
And so rhyme ill, am ill at envying.
And so she takes it with a natural grace,
And so the world went out,I felt no more.
And so they did, at last, Aurora.
And so we end, all three of us.
And so we rain our skies blue.
And so we weep, as if both body and soul
And so with art, we say. Give arts divine,
And so with her. She counted me her years,
And so with Marian. If she saw at last,
And so with me it must be, unless I prove
And so with more works. Whoso cures the plague,
And so with others. It may be, perhaps,
And so, twas fixed;and so, from day to day,
And so, a month passed. Let me set it down
And so, abandoned to a bitter mirth,
And so, another mile, without a word.
And so, as froward babes, we hide our eyes
And so, cold, courteous, a mere gentleman,
And so, henceforth, I put the shutters up;
And so, her very curiosity
And so, like most young poets, in a flush
And so, self-girded with torn strips of hope,
And so, that little stone, called Marian Erle,
And so, the Devil leaves him without pence,
And so, this book, Aurora,so, your book.
And so, through forced work and spontaneous work,
And so, without a word, we walked a mile,
And social comfort, in a hospital,
And softly pricked by golden crocus-sheaves
And solve so, these hard social questions,nay,
And some in wondering scorn,‘What next? what next?
And some one comes ... the same who brought me here.
And some one near me said the child was mad
And something written, something thought;
And sometimes harshly will he speak:
And somewhat hurried, as he crossed himself,
And somewhere in the pod.They left me so.
And soothsayers in a tea-cup?
And sought her ever in my walks and prayers,
And spare me yet, the burden of your eyes.
And speak still, and am silent,just for him!
And spelled me by the fireside, half a life!
And spends more passion, more heroic heat,
And spent her pity on me,made me calm
And spiritual from natural, grade by grade
And spiritual,who separates those two
And splash the altars with it. You might think
And spoke more like a flute among green trees,
And spoke out calmly. ‘Let us ponder, friend,
And spoken of my favourite books ... ‘our books ...
And sprang down, bounded headlong down the steep,
And spread his mantle dark and cold,
And staggers blindly ere she sink?
And stamping with imperious baby-feet,
And standing, muffled round with woe,
And stands sublimely in the nude, as chaste
And stare at, as at something wonderful
And stare on voyagers. Peak pushing peak
And stared at me as if I had been a ghost,
And startle the slant roofs and chimney-pots
And steady eyelids, cannot condescend
And steel myself, when rightly vexed with you,
And still disclosing some brown convent-tower
And still I feel his melancholy eyes
And still our love be sweeter for our work,
And still the artist is intensely a man
And still transferred to picture, music, verse,
And still went seeking, like a bleating lamb
And still, devouring the safe interval
And stir no dangerous embers. Fail a point,
And stood as quiet as a beaten ass
And stood beside the bed. The old idiot wretch
And stood by breathless, hanging on their lips,
And stood in it a-glow. ‘How beautiful,
And straight outreaches all things.
And straightway dropped my eyes upon my book,
And strain together rather, each to each,
And strata, flowers and creatures, very good,
And stringing pretty words that make no sense,
And stroke the placid patience of its cheeks,
And stronger sometimes, holding out their hands
And struck him; ‘Would he carry,he was just,
And struggling for my womans empery.
And stunn'd me from my power to think
And stupid, and distracted with the cries
And such a noise will follow, the last trumps
And such exception to a general law,
And such were bound to, I and she. But love,
And sucked your breath, as cats are fabled to do
And sucking vesture, it would drag us down
And sudden protestations of the spring.
And sun of the world beat blistering in my face;
And surelier happy. Then she dropped her lids,
And surge of natural feeling and event
And surgeons, beat some poets, in respect
And surging seas and aspectable stars,
And sweeping up the ship with my despair
And swept it grandly through the open doors
And swept my chamber clean of foolish thoughts.
And swoon back to the earth,and find ourselves
And swooned with noise,but still, along my swoon,
And take a blister on my brow instead
And take for a worthier stage the soul itself,
And take no blame. But pity, too, had dues:
And take so much as pity, from myself.
And take you with me to St. Margarets Court
And talk, with such a bird or such a goat,
And talked together of the child and me,
And talked with measured, emphasised reserve,
And teaching more. I triumphed oer you both,
And tears that at their fountain freeze;
And tell my cousin, merelyMarian lives,
And tell you in what Greek and Latin name
And temporal truths; the only holders by
And tender,to the little holdfast hands,
And that explains it.
And that I chiefly bear to say such words,
And that intense refraction which burns back
And that its foolish, feeble, and afraid,
And that they drop upon me, now and then,
And that we need not be disturbed too much
And that, in truth, means sadder. For the rest,
And that, not wisely,though twas long ago,
And that, she can; for life in fellowship
And thats a fall, Aurora. Long ago
And thats his way of thinking, first and last;
And thats my choice, observe. For what remains,
And thats no wonder: death inherits death.
And thats not ill when twisted round a comb,
And thats success too.
And thats success: if not, the poems passed
And thats the horror of t, Miss Leigh.
And thats the measure of an angel, says
And thats the odds twixt soul and body-plague!
And thats the sort of Noah he is, Lord Howe.
And the highest fame was never reached except
And the lark soars. It is not thus with men.
And the last fire-fly dies off in the maize.
And the open letter, rested on my knee,
And then
And then a voice said, ‘Marian Erle. She rose;
And then abruptly, ... ‘Marian. Marians well?
And then at worse,if Romney loves her not,
And then calm, equal, smooth with weights of joy,
And then he dropped to silence.
And then his angels. Oh, it does me good,
And then I shook the tree too rough, too rough,
And then I spoke‘Accept the gift, I say,
And then I thought of Lady Waldemar
And then I turned, and held my finger up,
And then our dear Lord Howe! at last, indeed,
And then sat down and thought.... ‘She shall not think
And then sate down, in trouble at myself,
And then she stopped: her face was white as wax.
And then was silent.
And then well have
And then, ... the rest. I cannot surely speak.
And then, and there, she saw and heard him first.
And then, as now, the day prepared
And then, half wandering ... ‘I have loved her well,
And then, theres love and love: the love of all
And then, who knows? he may not like me now
And then, with indrawn steady utterance, said,
And then, with just a word, ... that ‘Marian Erle
And then, with scarce a stirring of the mouth,
And there confronted at my chamber-door,
And there his voice swayed as an Alpine plank
And there I sate, one evening, by the road,
And there you sate, most perfectly shut in
And there, they say, she has tarried half a week,
And therell be women who believe of you
And theres his unread letter.
And therefore did He come into our flesh,
And therefore more than free to take his part,
And therefore, half in trust, and half in scorn
And these articulated veins through which
And these salt waters have had scarcely time
And these two gentlemen were bold, I marked,
And think all ended.Then, Life calls to us
And think by systems; and, being used to face
And think of leaving London, England even,
And think, for comfort, how, that very night,
And think, that somewhere in the waste
And thinkers disagreed; he, overfull
And thinking `this will please him best,'
And this more vexing heart-beat.
And this of minewell, granting to myself
And this poor flower of poesy
And this would set me higher by the head
And thou art lonely, and the child is half
And thou hast made him: thou art just.
And thou shalt stand unwearied, night and day,
And thou, O Lord, art more than they.
And though twas altered perfectly since then.
And though I hate you frankly,take my Smith!
And though men push and poke and paddle int
And though thats worthy, though thats full of balm
And though the thing displease us, ay, perhaps
And though you will not find me worth your pains,
And though, perhaps, these strollers still strolled back,
And thought can never do the work of love!
And thought I should be better soon perhaps
And Thought leapt out to wed with Thought
And thought to distance all men in success,
And three times. Well, hes married; that is clear.
And threw his noble head back toward the moon
And threw it in the thickest of the world,
And through his mornings, ‘Weep a little still,
And through their tops, you saw the folded hills
And thrusts the thing we have prayed for in our face,
And thus beloved, she died. Ive heard it said
And thus continued,
And thus I came here to abase myself,
And thus my cousin Romney wants a wife.
And thus my fathers sister was to me
And thus she had grown, this Marian Erle of ours,
And thus she is better, haply, of her kind,
And thus, as did the women formerly
And thus, I would not have you. Let it pass:
And thus, to snatch her soul from atheism,
And thus, to wed here, loving there, becomes
And tie it with blue ribbons at the end
And tie their hearts with love-knots to your feet,
And tigers couchant,struggling in amaze
And tingle through its cold to his burning lip,
And tire of the angels?Men define a man,
And told you nothing. God, if I could die,
And took her smile off, in sedate disgust,
And took no honours, yet was honourable.
And took you down, and took you round about
And topples round the dreary west,
And tore the violets up to get the worms.
And touch my hills with radiance not their own;
And towers fall'n as soon as built
And towers of observation, clears herself
And trade is art, and arts philosophy,
And trampers will secure you presently
And trampled by their hoofs. I heard the cries
And travell'd men from foreign lands;
And treacherous soft eyes, and slippery locks
And treat me, haply, as I were alive;
And tremble if one shook her from her fit
And tremble while ye are stedfast. Still, ye go
And trips him from his honourable sense
And triumph of the poet,who would say
And truly, I reiterate, ... nothings small!
And truly, though the truth is like a jest,
And trundles back his soul five hundred years,
And trusting me at once. And thus, at once,
And truth outlives pain, as the soul does life.
And tumble up your good clothes, veil and all,
And tumbling rafters, rose at once and roared,
And turn it to our Tuscan peoples use,
And turn your whiteness dead-blue. I looked up;
And turned and went. Ay, masks, I thought,beware
And turned her wild sad face from side to side
And turned me from the garden evermore
And turned them to the walls care. Ay, but now
And turning outward, with a sudden wrench,
And twice a prison,back at intervals,
And unabashed by even your silence.
And understand my last wordsthese, at last!
And understand,that youre the gentleman
And unimagined fingering, shuffling off
And unlearn thy sweet seeming. Pay the price
And unto me no second friend.
And up, beside it, streamed the festa-folk
And use it for an anvil till he had filled
And use it roughly, without stint or spare,
And use of your own instinct,merely proves
And use the womans figures naturally,
And used his kingly chrisms to straighten out
And used me in your noble work, our work,
And vacant chaff well meant for grain.
And various popular synopses of
And veer out by the force of holding fast.
And verify my abstract of the book?
And verily, many thinkers of this age,
And very sorry that I quoted back
And very sorry. Yet my creature said
And very tender liking. May you live
And vexed you so much. You find, probably,
And view the city perish in the mist
And view the grounds most gentle dimplement,
And view these things, and never tease his soul
And violence is now turned privilege,
And vow she does not wonder,and they two
And wails on while the household goes to wreck
And wait for rains. O poet, O my love,
And wait on all the changes of the moon
And waited,floating out their soft white hands
And wake up with corruption, ... cheek to cheek
And wake us up with headache. Ay, and soon
And wander on the hills an hour or two,
And want more room.
And wants another volume like the last.
And warmed his Sunday potage at your fire.
And was shut out. The closed persiani threw
And was the day of my delight
And washing seven times in the ‘Peoples Baths
And watch the morning quicken in the grey,
And watching gnats a-prick upon a pond,
And waved us off from touching evermore
And waves that sway themselves in rest,
And way, perhaps! to prove her sympathy
And we ... where tend we?
And we can talk the same thing there as here.
And we two cousins met before the dead,
And we with singing cheer'd the way,
And we would sooner vex a soul in heaven
And we, who did not speak too loud, within;
And we, who make excuses for the rest,
And wear a gladder faith in what we gain ...
And wear my chin-cloth for a wedding-veil,
And wed me at St. Jamess, nor put off
And wed you,will it, Romney? Heres the point;
And weekly papers, holding up my name
And weep as I do. Tears, tears! why, we weep?
And weep the fulness from the mind:
And went: and yet his thought disturbed my life:
And wept my tears, and now was cool and calm;
And were then, simply that you chose to be:
And what he ‘thought, poor Vincent! what he ‘thought,
And what he chooses, act or wife, I think
And what her soul is,that, she is herself,
And what I do falls short of what I see
And what I said, is unrepented of,
And what to me remains of good?
And what was better than to draw the threads
And what, permitted. Poet, doubt yourself;
And when a gentle hand held out a cup,
And when a woman says she loves a man,
And when he said ‘poor child, I shut my eyes
And when he says at moments, ‘Poor, poor Leigh,
And when he went, and when weve talked of him:
And when hes fairly married, he a Leigh,
And when I failed him,for I failed him, I
And when I heard my fathers language first
And when I miss him not he me Ill come
And when I stand beside a dying bed,
And when I used the pause in doubting that
And when I yearned to loose a fingerlo,
And when it seemed he had missed my love,he thought,
And when it was her turn to have the face
And when my heads done aching, in the cool,
And when she answered ‘ay, would toss her down
And when she spoke a fondling word, I shrank,
And when the face was finished, throat and hands,
And when we think to find him dead and charred ...
And when, at last, we are hushed and satisfied,
And where the Muse walks, lovers need to creep:
And whether such poor herb sufficed to grow,
And which I smote upon the cheek with words,
And which of our two large explosive hearts
And while I stared away my childish wits
And while they talked, and Marian felt the worse
And while we scorn him for a flower or two,
And whistling in back alleys to the moon,
And who believes a story of a ghost?
And who but you can wonder? He has been mad,
And who, moreover, having seen her face,
And whosoever writes good poetry,
And why not fifteen? why not ten? or seven?
And why, you know notdid you eliminate,
And wildly dash'd on tower and tree
And will the wind change by to-morrow morn?
And wills more consciously responsible,
And windows, with a hideous wail of laughs
And wish to use it for a dog to-day,
And wished them redder,you remember Vane?
And wished, at intervals of growing sense,
And wishes me a paradise of good,
And with his own life dazed and blinded him!
And with my heart I muse and say:
And with the silver arrow from his height,
And with the thought her colour burns;
And with two grey-steel naked-bladed eyes
And witness, ‘She who did this thing, was born
And woke up pelted with a childish laugh
And woman,if another sate in sight,
And wondered if their mothers beat them hard,
And wondered, while, along the tawny light,
And wondering what had happened up in heaven,
And wonders at the gods that we must be,
And work among Christs little ones, content,
And works it turbid.
And worldlings in it are less merciful
And worn the yellow daylight into shreds
And worthily of us both!
And would be alone to say them, I with you,
And would be gracious, were I not a Leigh,
And would not interrupt your life with ours.
And would not leave hershe had winning ways
And would not miss a vigil in the church,
And would not miss the fortune. Ah, my friend,
And would not, to save mine.
And wrapping the whole house, which disappeared
And wrapt thee formless in the fold,
And wrapt us wholly, could we draw its shape,
And wrinkled her smooth conscience with a sense
And writes above, ‘The house of Nobody:
And writing lightlier for the heavy fact,
And wrong thoughts make poor poems.
And wrote because I livedunlicensed else:
And yearn toward some one else, who yearns away
And yellow roses. Paris has such flowers.
And yet tis all of which they are capable,
And yet twas hard,would almost make the stones
And yet a revelation in some sort:
And yet Aurora Leigh must guard her voice
And yet because a man sins once, the sin
And yet by no means ignorantly maintain
And yet I could not, at this hour, afford
And yet I did not think youd leave the work
And yet I do not love you enough to-day
And yet I felt it in me where it burnt,
And yet I save him if I marry him;
And yet I should be stronger.
And yet I used him as a sort of friend;
And yet I wish, indeed, you had never come
And yet Ill try out your perhapses, sir;
And yet Ive been more moved, more raised, I say,
And yet perhaps you had been startled less
And yet the last ‘Well done will touch him more,
And yet the merit int is thrown away
And yet the yews green longer, and alone
And yet they brought it! Hells so prodigal
And yet they cry for carrion.O my God,
And yet we trust it comes from thee,
And yet what women cannot say at all,
And yet who knows if I had seen my way
And yet, forbid,
And yet, if once they loved, that love of theirs
And yet, indeed, your book has dealt with me
And yet, now even, if Madonna willed,
And yet, this may be less so than appears,
And yet, with such in his hand, a man like Leigh
And yet, you loathed not Romney,though youve played
And you and Israels other singing girls,
And you fail utterly, by concluding thus
And you see, and I hate to see,for Howe
And you shall walk this road with silken shoes,
And you who grieved for all mens griefs ... what then?
And you, a woman! It was in youyes,
And you, be liberal in the sweeter way,
And you, youre sorry, cousin. Well, for me,
And youll forgive me some unseemly spasms
And youre his cousin, lady, after all,
And younger women who still care for books.
And yours, Aurora,like a punished child,
And, after contract at the altar, pass
And, after our first girding of the loins
And, after seven, I might consider it,
And, apprehending, I resolved by prose
And, as I thought I could breathe freer air
And, as Im both, Ill witness to the world
And, as it deepens, drowns the written word,
And, as we sate, we felt the old earth spin,
And, as we walked, the colour of the time,
And, being but poor, I was constrained, for life,
And, breaking on him in a storm of tears,
And, breaking through the talk and through the work,
And, but for you, I might have won his love,
And, by degrees, when he who had chosen her,
And, by my only fault, his empty house
And, certain of vocation, set your soul
And, cousin Romney, pardon me the word,
And, cousin, youll not move my root, not you,
And, creeping through the golden walls of gorse,
And, crown'd with all the season lent,
And, eager for her sake to rescue him,
And, even when she turn'd, the curse
And, every time she came, my veins ran cold,
And, feeling the hard marble first relent,
And, folding up her hands as flowers at night,
And, from his visceral heat, pluck out the roots
And, from the imaginations crucial heat,
And, going straightway to the neighbouring room,
And, grant me, the presentment had been newer
And, hand in hand, well go where yours shall touch
And, having left the glass, she turns
And, having missed this year some personal hope,
And, having promised faith to Marian Erle,
And, hearing shes beloved, is satisfied
And, if a moralist reproved her dress,
And, if Cervantes had been greater still,
And, if I would not rather pore upon
And, if she sees her name, Ill see her smile,
And, if so, then theyre not too proud to-day
And, if they find a piece behind the door,
And, if we leave the damp side of the wall,
And, if you brought him here, ... I warrant you
And, if you cannot, ... better take a trade
And, if your apprehensions competent,
And, in a certain house in Kensington,
And, in between us, rushed the torrent-world
And, in my Tuscan home Ill find a niche,
And, in that hurtle of united souls,
And, in that we have nobly striven at least,
And, in the open doorway, sate a girl
And, in this, ever would be more behind
And, into which, you cannot see an inch
And, just because on all these lesser gifts,
And, just in front, beyond the lime and bricks
And, just to pace the Pitti with you once,
And, long ere this, that Lady Waldemar
And, many a Tuscan eve, I wandered down
And, meantime, lives on quite the common way,
And, not to work in vain, must comprehend
And, notwithstanding, quite as audible
And, now I find her ... do we throw away
And, now that youve forgot her utterly
And, oh my heart, ... the sea-king!
And, old at twenty, was inclined to pull
And, only by the foam upon the bit,
And, past the quays, Maria Novellas Place,
And, plant a poets word even, deep enough
And, rounding to the spheric soul the thin
And, seeing we had books among the hills,
And, shuddering, wriggled down to the unclean;
And, since the grasses round me wave,
And, some day, therell be found a man to dote
And, staring out at us with all their blue,
And, swinging it beside me as I walked,
And, that once, mea dubious woman dressed
And, though he thought still of her,
And, though you stretched your arms, cry back and cling,
And, thy dark freight, a vanish'd life.
And, to you, I have shown my naked heart,
And, where the Graces walk before, the Muse
And, where warm hands have prest and closed,
And, while the moon came suddenly out full,
And, while with their spondaic prodigious mouths
And,glancing on my own thin, veinéd wrist,

are
Are apt to fossilise her girlish mirth,
Are born so, often, nor the quicklier die,
Are but as servants in a house
Are married safely and smoothly every day,
Are mixed, confounded; if we are loved or love,
Are nobler still, my cousin; and, I own,
Are not so fine they cannot bear the rain,
Are oracles of vital Deity
Are reading haply from some page of ours,
Are represented fully, mixed and merged,
Are rich and free to choose a way to walk?
Are rubbed so,yet twas something like to this,
Are shut beyond our sense, broke in on us,
Are tied up fast with hedges, nosegay-like;
Are trodden underfoot by vicious men,
Are turned, too, overmuch like some poor verse
Are tyrannously pretty,and I swore
Are we not drawn onward to new era?
Are we not drawn onward, we few, drawn onward to new era?
Are whiter than her morals,you, for one,
Are wholly dull in keeping ignorant
Are winged like angels. Every knife that strikes,
Are wrong in just my sense, who understood
Are you the Aurora who made large my dreams

as'
As twere a rose, and pricks you carefully
As a cobweb ... catching every fly of doubt
As a dog might, or child, to touch your hand
As a full-blown rose uneasy with its weight,
As a garden-statue a child pelts with snow
As a mans voice or breath is called his own,
As a soul from the body, out of doors,
As a vulgar bit of shame,as if, at best,
As a windmill seen at distance radiating
As a woman. But a child may say amen
As all of us leave God. You thought perhaps,
As almost you could touch them with a hand,
As also in birth and death. Whoever says
As an east wind had been. I who talked of art,
As angels, but he cannot see as deep,
As answers even to make a marriage with,
As any distressed sempstress of them all
As any fair grand-duchess in her teens,
As any glad proud mother in the world,
As any last years annual, in whose place
As any leaping fawn from a huntsmans grasp,
As any of the economists. Reform,
As any stronger stuff might. For my part,
As Austrias daughter to imperial France,
As awful as in stockings, after all,
As babes at baubles held up out of reach
As bare as winter, of those summer leaves
As being a part of beautys self. Adieu!
As being not small, and more appreciable
As being, Heaven help us, less poetical
As Blowsalinda. Drape us perfectly
As blue as Aarons priestly robe appeared
As bread at sacrament, we taste and pass
As bruised snakes crawl and hiss out of a hole
As Buonarroti down in Florence there,
As catching up to-day and yesterday
As chances still with women, if we write
As chaste, or nearly so, as Potiphars;
As children play at fashioning dirt-pies
As children, cowslips:the more pains they take,
As clean as any lady of our house
As clean as this, and so I am almost rich,
As clocks are voluble with lead.
As cobwebs on a tawny monument
As coloured and confirmed in aftertimes
As competent to sorrow for mankind
As courtly ladies the fine trick of trains,
As cream turns cheese, if buried long enough.
As dark as ten feet under, in the grave,
As dead as must be, for the greater part,
As dew on autumn cyclamens: alone
As dice i the game of beauty, sure to win;
As doublets, by the colour. Otherwise
As down I went, saluting on the bridge
As drowsy as the shepherds. What is art,
As earth grows clearer ... slowly, by degrees,
As easy find a footstep on the sand
As easy reading as the dog-eared page
As Eden-dew went up and fell again,
As Eve with natures daybreak on her face;
As even to snatch my bonnet by the strings,
As evening empties morning into night,
As every child will love the years first flower,
As falcon set on falconers finger may,
As famished hounds at a hare. She heard them yell,
As far as dead folk can; and then indeed
As far as God,away! They yelled at her,
As far as may be for some secret stir
As far as two souls can,ay, lean and league,
As far as, and no farther, than tis truth;
As fast as if to find my father there,
As fast, to Florence.
As forest-leaves, stripped suddenly and rapt
As formerly I failed to live,and thus
As God did, first.
As God did, last.
As God made women, to save men by love,
As God sees things, I have a wife and child;
As good as one I knew before.... Farewell.
As good as orange-water for the nerves,
As grass to graves, as moss to mildewed stones,
As green as any privet-hedge a bird
As half perplexed between the angelhood
As hard as in a sick room. After all
As having the same warrant over them
As He and I were equals,you, below,
As he stood opposite, face and curls a-flame
As Heaven itself to men, through pangs of death,
As heavy as fate. Ill bring you either sketch.
As heavy as the nightmare of a seer;
As her other jewels. If shes somewhat cold,
As Hindostanee to an Ind-born man
As HIS at me ... when waking up at last ...
As honeyed bees keep humming to themselves;
As humble as God makes me at the last,
As huntsmen throw the ration to the pack,
As husband of the Lady Waldemar
As I am, and Im very vilely proud,
As I pee sir, I see Pisa!
As I saw them, with conscious lids astrain
As I spoke, I tore
As I, though thus restrained, for two, shall love!
As I, with all my blots: with all my blots!
As Im a woman and know womanhood,
As Ive played mine.
As if a ghost had drawn me at the point
As if a man,there are such, let us own,
As if a prick would leave them flat. Does heaven
As if a statue spoke that could not breathe,
As if a viper with a pair of tongs,
As if afar they took their point of sight,
As if an inspiration from within
As if an urgent heat had started there
As if for taming accidental thoughts
As if for writing some new text of fate
As if from flax, not stone.
As if from lie or licence. Certainly
As if God verily made you for yourselves,
As if Gods creatures otherwise were lost,
As if Gods finger touched but did not press
As if he had done with morning. There I stopped,
As if he had dropped his alms into a hat,
As if he had touched it freely:heres my hand
As if he knew needs must, or I should die,
As if he knew the rest was merely talk
As if he sate on all twelve thrones up-piled,
As if he stood on the other. Youll be bound
As if his mallet struck me from my height
As if I caught at grasses in a field,
As if I had caught sight of the fires of hell
As if I had slept, then?
As if I had snatched it: thats not she, at least.
As if I led her by a narrow plank,
As if I should not, harkening my own steps,
As if I, too, were something. Sweet the help
As if it hurt him,‘Soft! no blasphemy,
As if it irked him much to know me there,
As if it were a holy thing like grief?
As if it were an iron crown and pressed?
As if it were our purse! What brings you here,
As if it were the finish of all time,
As if my heart were kept beneath a glass,
As if no human heart should scape alive,
As if no other man than I, could pull,
As if no other work were paramount.
As if on the outside, and not overcome?
As if one came back from the dead and spoke,
As if one could not pass through doors at all
As if one hated me, who had power to hurt;
As if she had fingered me and dog-eared me
As if she had told me not to lie or swear,
As if she said, ‘I know theres something wrong;
As if she tried it in a ‘tiring glass
As if she were a woman. We who have clipt
As if some patient passionate despair
As if some riddle of a summer-cloud
As if still ignorant of counterpoint;
As if the earth had suddenly grown too large
As if the floating moonshine interposed
As if the gold would tarnish,his grave lips
As if the plume upon a heros casque
As if the quiet bones were blest
As if the wind had caught that flower of her,
As if the wind had swept it off! you grudge
As if the worst, could happen, were to rest
As if they entertained i the name of France
As if they got some ease by it.
As if they lived too high above the earth
As if they spied black-beetles on the floor,
As if they touched them. Let us strive for this.
As if to bear him like an oriflamme
As if to crush me. ‘I have read your book,
As if to draw it on to his embrace.
As if to quench upon his breast that voice.
As if to stand a moment were a feat,
As if we had seen her purple-braided head
As if you brought a candle out of doors,
As if you had time left for a logarithm!
As if you had walked, well say, no otherwhere
As if you loved me, that I may not die!
As if, in some more reasonable age,
As if, like pale conspirators in haste,
As impotently as Athenian wives
As instant! in the pretty baby-mouth,
As into a blackened socket, the great fire
As is the pavement of the churches here,
As Jove did Io: and, until that Hand
As judged innocuous for the elder girls
As July suns to ruins, through the rents,
As Leighs disciple. You may find her name
As light as carrier-birds in air;
As light November snows to empty nests,
As like to Marian, as one dead is like
As lilies, Bene ... or che chè because
As little as Nell Harts wedding. Blush not, Nell,
As long and silent as the ecstatic night,And
As long as I deserved it. Very kind.
As long as they keep quiet by the fire
As lost as ... I told him I should be lost;
As louder phrases thrown out by the men.
As low as when you speak to mourners new
As Lucifer, and won the morning-star
As make you poor again, thank God.
As Marian did. She lay there, stunned, half tranced,
As Marian Leigh, I know, I were not clean:
As Medicean Venus. But I know,
As men account of death, as long as God
As men call loving; there are bloods that flow
As men in dreams, who vainly interpose
As men may be hereafter, feel with men
As men plant tulips upon dunghills when
As men upon their death-beds thank last friends
As men use common things with more behind,
As men will,for I doubted,till at last
As men, at weakest, vilest, are in soul:
As might have well been learnt there,never moved,
As mine was, peradventure.
As ministering spirits to mourners, through a loss,
As mistress there ... the Lady Waldemar.
As much at issue with the summer-day
As much exceeding him, as he the boor,
As much upon the outside of a man,
As mute as any dream there, and escape
As my breath blew it, and resolve it back
As Natures general heart confessed itself
As not too good for using generously
As nothing more, worth seeing, remained behind?
As often as a stags. What make-believe,
As one
As one great famishing carnivorous mouth,
As one who had authority to speak,
As one who had done her work and shuts her eyes
As one who had forgot herself in grief
As one who laughs and cannot stop himself
As one who swims against a stormy sea,
As one who would not be afraid of fire;
As one, however far, shall yet be near
As other Titans, underneath the pile
As other women. If as well, what then?
As others pray, more perfectly absorbed
As our pure love, thro' early light
As passionate as fear, she tore her hands
As Payne Knight did, the mythic mountaineer
As peradventure she had touched a snake,
As perfect-featured as he yearns at Rome
As plain as men do: speak out, man to man;
As plums in ladies laps, who start and laugh:
As poets use ... the skies, the clouds, the fields,
As preparation ... Did I start indeed?
As pure and perfect as I say?
As pure,as Im a woman and a Leigh!
As quite impossible in Johnsons day
As ready for distracted ends and acts
As reasonably sorry for herself;
As red and still indeed as any rose,
As Regent Street to poets.
As restless as a nest-deserted bird
As Romney Leigh is.Faces!O my God,
As safe, sir, as your marriage! very good;
As saints with lions,we who are not saints,
As seraphs might, the making of the sun
As she is, poor lost innocent. ‘Disappear!
As sheep do, simply that they knew the way,
As sings the lark when sucked up out of sight,
As sketchers do their pencils; nor Mark Gage,
As sleeping mothers feel the sucking babe
As snow thats drifted from the garden-bank
As some childs go-cart in the street beneath
As some drowned city in some enchanted sea,
As some grown man, who never had a child,
As some intruding, interrupting fly
As some love eyes that have wept so much, see clear,
As some strong winner at the foot-race sighs
As some tall ship, first conscious of the wind,
As some wise hunter creeping on his knees
As somebody were walking on my grave.
As sovran nature does, to make the form;
As still as when a silent mouth in frost
As still it might be wishedfine sleights of hand
As such a worthless friendship. Be content,
As surely as I wept just now at yours,
As surely as the trapped hare, getting free,
As surely as to others.
As Susan gave it to her hand last night:
As sword that, after battle, flings to sheathe;
As tender surely for the suffering world,
As that bronze opposite! nay, the bronze has faults;
As the antique tomb which said to travellers, ‘Pause,
As the earth
As the English will, because they find it so,
As the garments, the will dissolute as the acts,
As the ointment-box broke on the Holy feet
As the very bowl, in which he dips his beard.
As they had, howbeit not their way. He spoke.
As tho' they brought but merchants' bales,
As those smile who have no face in the world
As though she had wronged them somehow. I suppose
As truth is always. Yet ... a princely man!
As twenty bloodhounds! shakes you, strangles you,
As twist about a thyrsus; pretty too,
As two strong arms will always raise a child
As Venice on the waters, the sea-swan.
As we are, and vouchsafes the kiss thats due
As we descended following Hope,
As we do, when God says its time to die
As we kill roses.
As we passed,
As we spoke, the grass
As weakness,strength by no means. How is this,
As well as early master of Leigh Hall,
As well as for the trouble of my ascent
As well as pre-supposes? or perhaps
As well as you, sir, weary and in want
As well give up at once, sit down at once,
As well in this as He has.Farewell, you,
As well suppose my little handkerchief
As well, perhaps, as ere he saw me fret,
As wheeled by Seeing spirits toward the east,
As when twas almost good and had the right,
As when for instance I was hurt one day,
As when the hard sea bites and chews a stone
As when the Spanish king did crown the bones
As when the sudden finder of the wind
As when you paint your portrait for a friend,
As white as moonshine, save for the oozing blood.
As white, which, taken in a sudden wind,
As wind upon the alders, blanching them
As wisdom cut it off from fellowship,
As women are but Auroras!there are men
As worth an artists study for the folds,
As writer and as heiress, open it
As you are you ... I only Aurora Leigh.
As you in women-fishes. If we mix
As you the creaking of the door, years past,
As you, the male license. So, I wish you well.
As young birds must. ‘Well done, she murmured then,
As yours last Friday at a turkey-cock.
As, in this ragged, narrow life of mine,
As, sitting on the moon, to guess the earth!
As, then and ever since, I have, by God,

At ‘fox and goose about him with your soul:
At a fatal Aulis, for the winds to change,
At any mans door, Here, tis probable
At any woman who walks here alone.
At any womans foot, who misconceives
At best its not all ease,at worst too hard:
At board, at bed, at work, and holiday,
At both sides, comprehending, too, the souls,
At bowls, with such as my dead father is.
At broken moments of the noontide glare,
At Delphi. Think,the god comes down as fierce
At earliest morning to the door.
At early morning, laid across my bed,
At early morning,would not wait so long
At equal years, because she is disallowed
At fairs on tight-rope, till the babies dropped
At falling off, and took a score of songs
At first from week to week, then day by day,
At first he thought her dead; but when he had wiped
At first she never mooted with herself
At first,
At Florence, with my pictures. I can hear
At foolish unaware: whereat I smiled,
At germane Wertherism; my Paris rounds
At Göttingen, enough philosophy
At Hampstead? will the ale be served in pots?
At holy Marys shrine, and never blush;
At hoping I should learn to write your notes
At last I please you?How his voice was changed!
At last I spoke to Lady Waldemar:
At last then, peerless cousin, we are peers
At last we shall grow hard too, like the rest,
At last were even. Ah, youve left your height;
At last, because the time was ripe,
At last, to finish that doxology,
At least tis mournful. Fame, indeed, twas said,
At least I am a poet in being poor;
At least my souls life, without alms from men;
At least with letters.
At least youd take these letters to be writ
At least your kindness and encouragement.
At least, earth separates as well as heaven.
At Leigh Hall, christianised from Fouriers own,
At need! I like youthere, she took my hands
At nothinghold your finger up, she laughed,
At once below the dignity of man,
At once, as I must have them, to be sure,
At once,I have been wrong, I have been wrong.
At once: good aims not always make good books:
At one end of the swinging wreath, and said
At other moments, go to fetch a thing,
At Paris. Would ten roubles buy a tag
At parting, Marys image round my neck
At plaiting straws,her black hair strained away
At poetrys divine first finger-touch,
At prettiest, under the said hood, preserved
At sea, in storm!wait now....
At strongest, women are as weak in flesh,
At strongest. Try it,fix against heavens wall
At such a vexer of Arcadian peace,
At such an hour, or bid you. No excuse.
At such times, ended seemed my trade of verse;
At that last hour to please him well;
At the button-hole with honourable red;
At the chariot-wheels; all government, some wrong:
At the farthest end of the aisle. Then spoke a man,
At the roots, before those moralising stars
At this or that box, pulling through the gap,
At which a cry rose up‘Well have our rights.
At which a new note comes and shapes the tune,
At which her soul ached back into the dark
At which I interrupted my own thought
At which I shot my tongue against my fly
At which I stopped her,‘This for me. And now
At which men laughed as if he had drowned a dog:
At which most womens arms unclose at once
At which she vanished, like a fairy, through
At which that bilious Grimwald, he who writes
At which the foremost of the progressists
At which the gentlest she grows arrogant
At which, suddenly
At whiles she let him shut my music up
At worst, that there were roses in the world.
At worst,if hes incapable of love,

Aurora ... Romney? But, in this last book,
Aurora Leigh does better: bring her book
Aurora Leigh, be humble. Shall I hope
Aurora Leigh, even ... should conceive his act
Aurora Leigh, or Vincent Carrington,
Aurora Leigh,when some indifferent rhymes,
Aurora Leigh: be humble.
Aurora never should be wife of mine.
Aurora! you forgive us, her and me?
Aurora! It is strange, with what a swell
Aurora, I could touch her with my hand,
Aurora, Ive my work; you know my work;
Aurora, that most radiant morning name,
Aurora, you and I. The world ... look round ...
Aurora. If he loves, at last, that Third,
Aurora.
Aurora? Here I meet you!We clasped hands.

ay
Ay, all the more, that we undo ourselves;
Ay, always! by the love he pressed for once,
Ay, but every age
Ay, fatal, ay. And who shall answer me
Ay, gashed by some tormenting circle of steel
Ay, hard to God, but not to Romney Leigh!
Ay, hearing double,Marians tale, at once,
Ay, loved me, with that retributive face, ...
Ay, many Christian teachers, half in heaven,
Ay, Marians babe, her poor unfathered child,
Ay, Miriam with them, sing the song you choose.
Ay, sent her forth with some one of your sort
Ay, sided with them at the washing-tub
Ay, spit on and so wiped out utterly
Ay, strange; but only strange that good Lord Howe
Ay, theres the fruit he planted! never look
Ay, vile, I say,well show it presently,

Be blessed too, Aurora. Ah, my sweet,
Be called unhappy. Measure not the work
Be comforted for Marian.
Be faithless of the kind of proffered love,
Be fished up, by Apollos divine chance,
Be good to me, Aurora, scorn me less
Be guilty,and the knowledge of her fault
Be happy!oh, in some esoteric sense
Be kinder with me. Let us two be friends.
Be lightened to redemption. The worlds old;
Be like them! shine, Aurora, on my dark,
Be mannerly at least. The child turned round,
Be merciful,speak quickly.
Be not filched from us like the other fun;
Be not his wife yet, to denounce the facts
Be patient with me wherefore you and I
Be patient with me. Never think me vile,
Be planted out of reach of any such,
Be praised fort leaning lovelorn with pink eyes
Be sorry for the unlicensed class, the poor,
Be sure tis better than what you work to get.
Be sure Im well, Im merry, Im at ease,
Be sure that mothers death-bed will not want
Be sure that, by some sleight of Christian art,
Be sure to read it rightly. So, I mused
Be tenants of a single breast,
Be these his daughters? Lear is thinking of
Be verily bitter as self-sacrifice,
Be witness twixt us two! and with the word,
Be witness for me, with no amateurs

Because a cheerful genius suits the times,
Because a cheerful genius suits the times?
Because a woman. For the truth itself,
Because a womans. Do you now turn round
Because aspiring only. Well be calm,
Because denied from giving you my soul
Because he had bound his hands and could not stir:
Because he has it, rather than because
Because he has married Lady Waldemar.
Because he holds that, paint a body well,
Because he sings it. Does a torch less burn
Because her brood is stol'n away.
Because I knew he did not love the girl
Because I know youll write the sooner fort,
Because I love the beautiful, I must
Because I was not worthy. Oh, deserved,
Because it needed help of Love:
Because its generous? Speak. Im bound to you,
Because myself was true in writing them.
Because not poets enough to understand
Because of a smooth skin?not he, not he!
Because of certain profits,which is wrong
Because of obliteration; more intense,
Because of Romney.
Because of something bitter in the thought;
Because of the overcoming shock perhaps,
Because of weakness. Power is justified,
Because our hearts, large-rounded as the globe,
Because she led, herself, an easy time
Because she liked accomplishments in girls.
Because she liked instructed piety.
Because she was a woman and a queen,
Because shes poor and of the people: shame!
Because some thoughts are fashioned like a bell
Because that world of yours has dealt with me
Because the drama, less sublime in this,
Because the purse lacks where he lost his heart.
Because the saints are so far off, we lose
Because the world is mad! You cannot count,
Because their grosser brains most naturally
Because this woman from her crystal soul
Because too, formerly, I sinned by her
Because true action is impossible.
Because unmothered babes, he thought, had need
Because we are of one flesh after all
Because we both stand face to face with men
Because we had a dream on such a stone,
Because we have her back, dead or alive.
Because were decent. Well, he had some right
Because were hungry. Who, in all this world,
Because you cannot shame me with your eyes?
Because you have a wife who loves you so,
Because youre somewhat giddy! theres the rule
Because your cousin takes me for a wife?
Because, precisely, Im an artist, sir,

before
Before ... wheres Moses?
Before a low door in the roof, and knocked;
Before a sweet friends grief,when, in his ear,
Before a woman makes a pounce on you
Before adulterous eyes.
Before he died and left me,grief and love.
Before her ... asked her counsel ... ‘had I erred
Before her,meekened to the child she knew:
Before him, with a staglike majesty
Before I answered, he was there himself.
Before I breatheexact the epic plunge
Before I came here.Ending, she was pale;
Before I ever knew him for a friend.
Before my brows be numb as Dantes own
Before my conscience, as in the open Book
Before my meditative childhood, ... as
Before our mothers furbished them with trains,
Before she does it,prate of womans rights,
Before the Adam in him has foregone
Before the amazèd hills ... why, so, indeed,
Before the day was born, or otherwise
Before the evening fell, I had a note
Before the four-faced silent cherubim:
Before the heart took fire and withered life
Before the hells were open,ah, before
Before the moon abolished them,destroyed
Before the next change comes.And, farther on,
Before the rain has got into my barn
Before the spark is quenched, or the palm charred,
Before the trees grew dangerous at eight,
Before they are taught her cursing. Faces!... phew,
Before they grow the ivy! certainly
Before they sit down under their own vine
Before they went to fossil, that anon
Before thy loudst protesting.For the rest,
Before two worlds.
Before you write yours. Cousin Vane did well,

being
Being acted on and acting seem the same:
Being apt to singe our singing-robes to holes,
Being busy in the woods? much less, being poor,
Being called to stand up straight as demi-gods,
Being good themselves, are good for herthe best
Being keeper to our brother, were his Cain.
Being man and human, can stand calmly by
Being present also in the unkissed lips,
Being satisfied with comfortwhen he changed
Being sold away to Lamia. My head aches;
Being starved to make your heads: so run the old
Being still together, will not miss a friend,
Being used for argument against the souls,
Being used to smile just so, without her eyes,
Being wheeled upon the terrace.
Being wronged by some five hundred nobodies

Beneath the trees, than wrong by such a word

Besides my Kate that if you walked on sand

Betwixt her eagles, blinking not her race,
Betwixt her foot and the earth, and raised her up
Betwixt her lover and her looking-glass,
Betwixt me and the enemys house behind,
Betwixt our highest conscience and the judge;
Betwixt the different planes of sensuous form
Betwixt the generous rich and grateful poor.
Betwixt the mirrors of its drawing-rooms,
Betwixt the seen and unseen,bursting through
Betwixt their prayers at vespers. Well, youre right,
Betwixt us two, forsooth, must be a word

beyond
Beyond it, sate in just the chair she placed,
Beyond it, voyaging the uphill road,
Beyond our mortal?can I speak my verse
Beyond the bounds of the individual man,
Beyond the circle of the conscious hills,
Beyond the critics reaching. Art itself,
Beyond the first wrong, Marian. When you left
Beyond the image on his eye, which came
Beyond the peaks of Lucca. Underneath,
Beyond the point of actual feeling!nay,
Beyond the point of what is mannerly.
Beyond the stroke of midnight. Get away;
Beyond the vulgar white of personal aims.
Beyond these senses,poetry, my life,
Beyond this blood-beat,passionate for truth
Beyond those doors. Twas natural, of course,
Beyond us both. The rings upon her hands
Beyond whats said of him in newspapers,
Beyond you; and I bore to take it in,

both
Both arms a-flame to meet her wishing Jove
Both credulous of completion. There I held
Both faces leaned together like a pair
Both halves. Without the spiritual, observe,
Both heads dropped closer than the need of talk:
Both heart and head,both active, both complete,
Both his to me in vain! I could not claim
Both manuscript and man,because a lord
Both noble and gentle,and, without it ... well,
Both rose and pain,except for this great loss,
Both speech and imagination? A starved man
Both time and place? Absurd. Keep up the fire,
Both watch and slumber with long lines of life
Both yours and yours. It is so good to know

but
But twas as if remembering they had wept,
But all he was is overworn.'
But all is wonder on such summer-nights;
But all the lavish hills would hum
But are you, peradventure, vexed at heart
But at least
But cannot hold a moment. How we twang
But certain flowers grow near as deep as trees,
But certainly well find her, have her out,
But cleanse herself, that, loving such a man,
But clenched her brows, and clipped me with her eyes
But come upon the parish, qualified
But could look either, like a mist that changed
But cries behind us, every weary step,
But culls his Faustus from philosophers
But Death itself could only better thee,
But deigned to let my carriage stop him short
But do not blush at all except for sin,
But drop the other down our bosoms, till
But England, also. Twas a yellow rose,
But even a witch, to-day,
But even its very tumours, warts, and wens,
But evermore, twixt waking and asleep,
But every day, feast, fast, or working-day,
But felt my smile too mournful for my word,
But fifty red wide throats must smoke at it,
But finds some coupling with the spinning stars;
But first, I must be heard a little, I,
But first,she pressed me with her urgent eyes
But first,I pray you pardon, that the shock
But found him all in all the same,
But gloses neither: if a Leigh could glose,
But go by all means,and permit the grass
But harder than you said them; every time
But he loved largely, as a man can love
But he touched, just touched
But he, he made the church with what he spoke,
But he, he nipped the bud of such a thought
But help thy foolish ones to bear;
But heres an inter-marriage reasoned out,
But heres no proof, sir, of acceptancy,
But hoarsely. When the fever took him first,
But I could not hide
But I mistook my own heart,and that slip
But I paused.
But I was safe for that time, and he too;
But I who saw the human nature broad,
But I, as a dog a-watch for his masters foot,
But I, because I am a woman perhaps,
But I, being most unworthy of these and that,
But I, convicted, broken utterly,
But I, I sympathise with man, not God,
But if tis sweet for love to pay its debt,
But if it were not truly for our eyes,
But if not,I would rather lay my hand,
But if, a simple fealty on one side,
But II was not Juno even! my hand
But just a mother. Only for the child,
But just the rich man and just Lazarus,
But keep from misconception, too, yourself:
But keeps dry linen equally,unlike
But kept the mystic level of all forms
But knows no more of transient form
But knows the things she shouldnt, with wide-awake
But learn this: I would rather take my part
But let me feel your perfume in my home,
But life upon the larger scale, the higher,
But lived as one entranced, with thoughts, not aims,
But long since. Im a woman,it is true;
But loose himtheyll not change; he well might seem
But low and far, upon Sicilian shores!
But loyal to the low, and cognisant
But Lucy, sir, was always slow at work,
But make my life as smooth as marriage-ring,
But man, the two-fold creature, apprehends
But measured always. She was generous, bland,
But men, and still less women, happily,
But more of reverence in us dwell;
But mused upon her wild bad tramping life,
But never doubt that youre a poet to me
But never, never have forgot themselves
But next centenarys harvests. If we give,
But no more stars! mark that.
But not completed to an uncommon man,
But not for vacuums,so I am not sad:
But not his tones: can any one repeat
But not of Romney. He had good to do
But not ungentle when the aged poor
But now ... the birds were grown too proud for us!
But now I breathe,but now I pardon!nay,
But now the creatures all seemed farther off,
But now this must be. I have words to say,
But now, you promised me to say a word
But no-wise certain ... now here and now there, ...
But of some black chief, half knight, half sheep-lifter,
But ofter she was sorrowful with noise,
But oh, the night! oh, bitter-sweet! oh, sweet!
But only ... damned.
But only half, and merely to my shade,
But only he who sees, takes off his shoes;
But open converse is there none,
But others had to swindle her a place
But otherwise evades me, puts me off
But plainly she objected,and demurred,
But poets should
But prudent men Academicians are
But quiet,sitting at the wall to learn,
But rather, disproof. Deaths black dust, being blown,
But Romney,he has chosen, after all.
But sad Eva saved a stub.
But sate absorbed amid the quickening glooms,
But seeing, as in a rose-bush, Loves Divine,
But set hearts beating pure as well as fast:
But set within my reach by means of you:
But she
But she ... shed have her way, and have her cloak;
But simply, murdered.
But since it pleased a vanish'd eye,
But sit in London, at the days decline,
But slowly the ineffable light comes up,
But smiled and lay there. Like a rose, I said:
But smiled on, in a drowse of ecstasy,
But smooth green grasses are more common still;
But so it fell indeed. Our cousin Vane,
But so the star-fish does, and crosses out
But so we all are, when were praying God.
But so you were baptised into the grace
But soft!a ‘poet is a word soon said;
But softer certainly, and said to God,
But something suffered, after all.
But soul-strokes merely tell upon the flesh
But spoke on calm between its marble lips,
But stagnates in the weeds of sloth;
But stay!who judges?who distinguishes
But still I catch my mother at her post
But still the generous lady tried to keep
But still with such a face, so much alive,
But still, unscrupulously epic, catch
But stood there in her place, and spoke again.
But straight repeated,‘Marian. Is she well?
But strain and touch her in her upper sphere,
But such a long way, long way, long way off,
But suffer surely and keenly, when his class
But take her on my shoulder past this stretch
But takes its proper change out still in crime,
But tethers us to a lily or a rose
But that I loved you more than such a name.
But that large grief which these enfold
But that spoke louder. Not a word from you!
But that they would not touch you with their foot
But that, Ill never vouch for. What you do
But that, she had not lived enough to know
But the old world waits the hour to be renewed:
But the sun was high
But then he must stand still, nor take a step.
But then he saw the higher thing at once,
But then I did not think, ‘my Italy,
But then I rose and shook it off as fire,
But then Im thinking how his eyes looked ... his,
But then it passed, Aurora. A child cried;
But then my cousin sets his dignity
But then my mothers smile breaks up the whole,
But then she spoke. ‘It shall be as you please;
But then the thrushes sang,
But then, not wisely. I was heavy then,
But there are other griefs within,
But there, end compromise. I will not bate
But there, the lines swerved, trembled, though I sate
But these words dealt in sharper perfume,these
But thinking of a wreath. Large leaves, smooth leaves,
But this is somewhat dimmer than the rest
But this it was that made me move
But this last book oercame me like soft rain
But this man shrunk at nothing, never thought
But this same world you are come to, dearest coz,
But those,and so I flung them into paint
But though the gleaners apron holds pure wheat,
But throws you back upon a noble trust
But took the sleeping child and held it out
But tramp and tramp. And yet she knitted hose
But truly we all know you by your books
But understand. The blank, blind, weary way
But vaster. We are fools and slight;
But violets, aired and dewed by love like yours,
But vow away my years, my means, my aims,
But we, distracted in the roar of life,
But we, indeed, who call things good and fair,
But we, we talk!
But well not spare you an inch of our full height:
But weeping bitterly ... the pride keeps up,
But went of course. I have not touched on this
But what he said ... I have written day by day,
But what then, Romney? Though we fail indeed,
But when I looked, her face was younger ... ay,
But where the path we walk'd began
But which, in cackling, sets you thinking of
But while I stood and mused, a quiet touch
But who shall so forecast the years
But wholly, at last, I wakened, opened wide
But will not change it to a heliotrope,
But women are knights-errant to the last;
But work for ends, I mean for uses; not
But would be for your sake. Alas, alas!
But would he stop his carriage in Cheapside
But yesterday sobs took me by the throat,
But yesterday? I loved you for my part;
But you ... you caught them up with yours, and said
But you, be clean? What! ‘prudent compromise
But you, dear, and your story.
But youll be sure to master it, in spite
But yours, I know, is infinite. Farewell.
But yourself!
But youth was strong and overcame the test;
But, after all, this love!... you eat of love,
But, after Christ, work turns to privilege;
But, after I had read for memory,
But, brushing a green trail across the lawn
But, even so, God saved me; and, being dashed
But, first, this shameful marriage.
But, for the unquiet heart and brain,
But, having spoken what I came to say,
But, if indeed I loved, twas long ago,
But, if you are pious, sing a hymn and go,
But, if you listen, moans and cries instead
But, in which, the complete year seems to blow
But, Lady Waldemar, the points the thing
But, no more, work as Adam ... nor as Leigh
But, pausing just a moment to draw breath,
But, plainly, not to starve. You suffered then;
But, sometimes, as I stooped to tie her shoe,
But, that we choose it, proves it good for us
But, this time, in a dream, and hunted round
But, though you miss his chin, you seldom miss
But, turning grandly on his central self,
But, weep for me, Aurora? Yes, theres hope.
But, when in sight oft, within fifty yards,

By a contract,male Iphigenia, bound
By a gathering certain sense of being, on earth,
By a hundred needles, were to hang the tie
By a hundred years, and took her by surprise?
By a Leigh who wedded a French dancing-girl
By a simple word ... a broken easy thing,
By a sudden sense of vision and of tune,
By a supposition that she wanted these,
By a whirlwind on Valdarno, drop again,
By Adam, like a fakir in a box
By all true workers and true lovers born.
By an active poacher who had hit a hare
By an enemy to slay us, while we read
By any blow, or word even. Out-door jobs
By being content I spoke it, though it set
By being just God. Thats abstract truth, I know,
By being ungenerous, even to a book,
By chance I saw him in Our Ladys church,
By clever stitches. Im a woman, sir,
By clink of silver waters, in a muse
By coupling with it the dead bodys thought,
By doing rightly and kindly. Once he thought,
By drawing your name through them as a friends,
By dwellers at my villa: morn and eve
By faith, and faith alone, embrace,
By force of beauty, and the feeble wrong
By frigid use of life, she was not old,
By gods, since Bacchus had his way with grapes.
By good Sir Blaise and clever Mister Smith,
By great Thor-hammers driven through the rock,
By half-means, half-way, seeing half their wants,
By handfuls from me: I had writ my heart
By heaven, sir, when poor Damiens trunk and limbs
By his gesture ... torn in morsels, yelled across,
By his very pitying eyes. The snow, for him,
By holding up a wedding-ring, and then ...
By hoofs of maddened oxen into a ditch,
By imposition of the foreign hand,
By insects, stared to torture by the noon:
By issue and symbol, by significance
By just my love I might have saved this man,
By just the top sometimes,as difficult,
By Keatss soul, the man who never stepped
By law,the law which now is paramount;
By liberal peasants, naturally incensed
By life and love, that, if I lived like some,
By line on line, to draw you out a world,
By loitering with your elders.
By love or law from henceforthso he wrote;
By love, like others, self-aggrandisement,
By mans law! born an outlaw, was this babe.
By marrying him herself.
By me, ... for himyoull ask him presently
By me? I am a woman of repute;
By men who are uncommon,but within
By mere fortuitous concourse of old songs,
By mothers birth and grave, by fathers grave
By much persistent shining of the sun!
By nations or by sexes. Fouriers void,
By no means arrogantly? shes not proud;
By no means Buonaventures ‘Prick of Love,
By no means that you are not really vile,
By no means. Simply, that weve walked too far,
By one who never thinks about the toad
By one. ‘The devil it is! Im sorry fort.
By others, and herself too. Marian Erle
By re-iteration chiefly the same thing
By setting us to wait.‘Yes, yes, this Leigh
By sight and knowledge, then, youll speak your mind,
By signs and touches which are known to souls,
By sin i the blood,his spirit-insight dulled
By singing with the birds, and running fast
By sleeping infants. And we all have known
By slow degrees, it broke on her slow sense,
By smutty hands, though spotted from their white;
By so much reading. It is rather when
By some coarse scholar! I have been too coarse,
By some prodigious Dream-fear at my back
By some remote dynasty of dead gods,
By something in me, surely not my will,
By something in my face. Indeed twas sure
By speaking we prove only we can speak;
By spiteful nurses, ‘Never snatch, they say,
By such a grace in giving, might accept
By such a presence, yours and mine, to lift
By symbol, to instruct us formally
By taking me to wife: though, ever since,
By that blue vein athrob on Mahomets brow,
By that south window of the little house,
By the apparition of a new fair face
By the bees in it; past the lime, the lawn,
By the colour of the hair, the trick of the voice,
By the ghosts perhaps, that blow too bleak this way
By the moonlight there,
By the way,
By this time,and I must not let him wait.
By those blue eyes no woman born could dare
By those insufferable cicale, sick
By those who have not lived past it. Well suppose
By turning up their under-natures till
By turns some bed-rid creature and myself,
By using truth in courtship it is strong
By veritabler artists. Earth, shut up
By what was aimed above it. Art for art,
By young Achilles, when they pinned the veil

calm
Calm and deep peace in this wide air,
Calm and deep peace on this high world,
Calm and still light on yon great plain
Calm as to suit a calmer grief,
Calm is the morn without a sound,
Calm on the seas, and silver sleep,
Calm, in black garb. I clung about her neck,

can
Can calm despair and wild unrest
Can carve a score of white Loves out of snow,
Can do aught good. You shall not vex him,mark,
Can Guizot stand? is London full? is trade
Can make Auroras which vex nobody,
Can make good things from ill things, best from worst,
Can never reach them where they sit, to seem
Can never, never, never join hands so.
Can pluck a leaf, and find a lecture in t;
Can praise that art of yours no otherwise;
Can save man else than as He holds mans soul;
Can sin so, curse so, look so, smell so ... faugh!
Can stoop to tenderly and the wheatfields climb;
Can swell to a pair of nationalities,
Can talk with one at bottom of the view,
Can turn but one side to the sun at once.
Can women understand. You generalise

come
Come in by chance. Nay, since your Marians dead,
Come quick, thou bringest all I love.
Come stepping lightly down the plank,
Come then, pure hands, and bear the head
Come thou, my compensation, my dear sight,
Come up, and toil and moil, and change the world,
Come with me rather, where well talk and live,
Come, human creature, love and work with me,
Come, sweep my barns, and keep my hospitals,
Come, Time, and teach me, many years,

could
Could act the husbands coat and hat set up
Could any leave the bedrid wretch alone,
Could catch me at such admissions, I should pass
Could choose the town to live in!then she drew
Could clear her blinded face from all that stream
Could disapprove me, vex me, hamper me.
Could guess if ladys hall or tenants lodge
Could I see his face,
Could make a man, hed henceforth be a god
Could man have thanked him for it.
Could never be drained out with all their blood:
Could run no more, yet, somehow, went as fast,
Could scarcely fail to make him sensitive
Could show but dead-brown sticks and straws; the walls
Could strike out, as our masculine white heats,

Did I laugh or curse?
Did Lady Waldemar tell you she had seen

do
Do eagles, who have pinched a lamb with claws,
Do geese see God?
Do I look a Hagar, think you?
Do it still, and then we sit and laugh no more.
Do know myself to-night for what I was
Do otherwise conceive of love. Farewell.
Do wolves seduce a wandering fawn in France?

each
Each fancy squared, each feeling ranged by line,
Each flight they take: and fire-flies, that suspire
Each green leaf and each white leaf ruled in black
Each lovely lady close to a cavalier
Each prophet-poets book must show mans blood!
Each separate figure? Whom do we cheat by that?
Each smiling from the other, smiled and slept.

enough
Enough for me and for my fleshly heart
Enough for watering Eden. Obviously
Enough of life in so much!heres a cause
Enough so, Ganymede.
Enough so. Both were happy, he and Howe,
Enough so.
Enough that she alone has looked at him
Enough to please you. If we pray at all,
Enough to thaw her cream, and scorch his beard.
Enough. My horse recoiled before my heart
Enough: were parting ... parting. Cousin Leigh,

even
Even I and Romney may stand side by side,
Even I can scarce admit the cogency
Even I, affronting her exalted soul
Even I, felt something in the grand old trees,
Even now she reads my letters like a wife,
Even so my pastoral failed: it was a book
Even so!but not so stupid ... blind ... that I,
Even so, mine wandered from the things I heard,
Even so, we let go hands, my cousin and I,
Even then, was evil near us, it is writ.
Even these,‘You will not compass your poor ends
Even thus. I pause to write it out at length,

for
For tis not in mere death that men die most;
For a bending forehead. There I sate, and wished
For a crooked purpose, while poor Marian Erle
For a living husband! as the mans alive,
For a nation that runs fast,ay, runs against
For a pair of sky-blue eyes; our House of Lords
For action, all alive, and forced to prove
For agony or rapture, seeing that love
For Alaric as well as Charlemagne?
For all her blue eyes and her quiet ways,
For all her toothless gums,as Leigh himself
For all is dark where thou art not.
For all such cries. But if one cries from hell ...
For all that. One takes up the world with eyes.
For all the coarse Italian blacks and browns,
For all the cosmic wonder of Thy work,
For all this sunlight. You suppose, perhaps,
For all those hands!weve used out many nights,
For all those wild beasts, yelling, cursing round,
For all your roaring. Help me! for myself
For although
For Babylon or Balbec,when the breath,
For beers spilt easier than a woman is!
For being not ill-done. Let me set my mark
For being right modest. Yet how proud we are,
For being so sad a creature. ‘Mister Leigh
For body and verse, I stood up straight and worked
For bread, will taste of common grain, not grapes,
For burning next reflectors of blue steel,
For by the hearth the children sit
For carrying out Gods end. No creature works
For certain uses which he found to do
For charitable ends set duly forth
For church now?
For cloudy seasons!
For concords; when the rhythmic turbulence
For condemnation,I was guilty here:
For darning stockings past their natural age,
For draining off a martyr, or a rogue
For ease and whiteness! Wellyou know the world,
For even prosaic men, who wear grief long,
For even the finest; and the publics right,
For ever clean without a marriage-ring,
For ever on the ground! you must be low
For ever out of sight. Ay, Carrington
For ever to the tune of plague and sin
For ever, after some ideal good,
For ever, that the very fire and heat
For ever, that the worlds not paradise.
For ever, yet gain no step? Are we such,
For ever; by that strong excepted soul,
For everlasting laughters,I, myself,
For exhibition in my drawing-rooms
For fear to soil my gown in so much dust.
For foreheads; men say ‘crowns; and so we are crowned,
For gathering winter-faggots!
For God alone sits far enough above,
For God, in cursing, gives us better gifts
For Gods sake who has made them.
For good child-reasons, that he liked it so
For greeting, and the mornings compliment;
For guest or victim and came wandering out
For having done no better than to love,
For having missed the worst of all their wrongs,
For he will see them on to-night;
For he, a boy still, had been told the tale
For heart and lungs, for will and intellect,
For help. Beloved, let us love so well,
For her own broken heart. Theres not a crime
For her, the thing she sees, poor loyal child,
For here satiety proves penury
For hideous evils which she had not known
For his sake, if not mine.
For his sake, not their own. And yet I know
For his sake, Romneys! by the good he meant,
For his sake; it was simple.
For hours I sate and stared. Assuntas awe
For hours upon the floor, with knees drawn up,
For household uses and proprieties,
For hungry orphans to say audibly
For I in spirit saw thee move
For inner uses, from the things without.
For instance, compromise the wheaten bread
For instance, I have not seen Romney Leigh
For instance, to wed here, while you love there?
For instance, when I went to see the gods
For it was they, who set you where you are,
For just a moment.... ‘Heres a book, I found!
For just his uses, not her own at all,
For just so many days, just breathing room
For just two farthings, and God cares for each.
For keeping summits by annulling depths,
For kings and politicians, but still more
For kings to walk on, or our senators,
For knowledge is of things we see
For learning wrestling with long lounging sleeves,
For life and duty. Place your fecund heart
For losing your last footstep on the stair,
For love, so countedthe love possible
For loves sake merely. Ah, you force me, sir,
For manifester gains; let those who prize,
For many a witch to see inset it down
For many hours we talked. What need to talk?
For me Im sworn to never trust a man
For me theres somewhat less,and so, I sigh.
For me, Aurora: I would have no gifts
For me, I do believe in love, and God.
For me, I would not touch so light a thing,
For me, I wrote
For me, Id rather see a rick on fire
For me?and is there room beneath the stone
For meditation, when we are very strong
For men you know not, are as good as trees.
For merit lives from man to man,
For my part I would rather starve on gin
For my part, I am scarcely meek enough
For my part, I choose headaches,and todays
For my sake merely, use less bitterness
For native gifts or popular applause,
For nature,count nought common or unclean,
For none of all your words has been more lost
For nought? would sweetest Mary cheat her so,
For now hes happy,and she may indeed
For now her father's chimney glows
For now her little ones have ranged;
For now she understood, as such things were
For now so strange do these things seem,
For offshoots, you have done more for the man,
For oh, that it should take such innocence
For one as good as you are.
For one step forward, then you take it back,
For one who is not God, and cannot right
For other reasons than those topaz eyes
For other women, dear, we could not name
For others, with your naughty light blown out?
For others uses, will write now for mine,
For otherwise theyll starve before they die,
For otherwise we only imprison spirit,
For pagan phalanstery or Christian home,
For penance, by a saintly Styrian monk
For persons of his income, even to boors:
For poets, who bear buckets to the well,
For pretty pastime. Every now and then
For private sorrow's barren song,
For Proclus. Ah, I stained this middle leaf
For proving to myself that there are things
For putting out a hand to take a gift;
For refuge to the woman,as, sometimes,
For right-hand use, bared blue against the sky!
For Romney has a pattern on his nail,
For Romney Leigh or others having failed
For Romney Leigh to break his fast upon t,
For roses to stay after.
For rupture;herein we must break with Life,
For rye, the meat for lentils, silk for serge,
For say a foolish thing but oft enough,
For saying the thing I should not. Well I know
For she, at worst too, is a woman still
For she, being wise and good and born above
For since twas Athens so I read the myth
For since he had been covered over-much
For some great cure? No physic for this grief,
For something called a wife. He never asked.
For something came between them ... something thin
For something good and green to alight upon
For something like a joy. She liked, she said,
For soon it smiled at me; the eyes smiled too,
For sorrow,thinking how two hands, before,
For statues still, in this large world of Gods,
For such a cousin.
For such a little humpbacked thing as she;
For such a worm?And if I came and said ...
For such sleek fringes do you call them ends?
For taking up with Cupid at his worst,
For telling you a thing to tease you more.
For that caressing colour and trancing tone
For that day. After, some one spoke of me,
For that is fatal,their angelic reach
For that nights sleeping ... yet slept well. My God,
For that should please her always: let him write
For that stain of blue blood,I recollect
For that time.
For that to put them out in anything:
For that, she will not trust us often with
For thats his specialty. What creature else
For the legible life-signature of such
For the other side the Alps? it cannot be:
For the parish stocks, and Romney will be there
For the Renovator who had seemed absorbed
For thee,‘And I, for thee: this poet knows
For then, it seemed, some grand blind Love came down,
For theres some comfort in a marquisate
For these foot-catching robes of womanhood:
For this fair writer, and congratulate
For this time I must speak out and confess
For this: do you be strong to know hes strong:
For those dumb motions of imperfect life
For those ill looks. Observe‘I, means in youth
For those who pull the string.I never did.
For though you ran a pin into my soul,
For thrilling audient and beholding souls
For throwing back the matchhe would not hear:
For thus it is in heaven, that first God speaks,
For token or for solace, some small weed
For tolerable verse, intolerable
For touching coppers, though her hands be white,
For two together to bear out at once
For us. But any woman, womanly,
For uses, therefore, I must count worth while.
For walking to and fro upon the earth,
For what had I, I thought, to do with her,
For what is lightness but inconsequence,
For what might be.
For when I die and leave you, out you go,
For when she gasped, and pressed me with her eyes,
For when you have seen this famous marriage tied,
For which good deed I saved her: the rest went:
For which I dodged occasionlearnt by heart
For which I pleaded. Passioned to exalt
For which I thanked the Lady Waldemar,
For which inheritance beyond your birth
For which the First has proved inadequate,
For which three things I hate, hate, hate you. Hush,
For whom the black woods suddenly grow alive,
For whom the very mothers face forewent
For wifehood ... will she?
For winter-wear, when bodies feel a-cold,
For words, like Nature, half reveal
For you are none when I shall tell the truth,
For you or me to dig it up alive;
For your sake, sweet, and make it mild as heaven,
For, ‘trust no tree by moonlight, Tuscans say
For, after that, I oftener sate at home
For, on the sixth week, the dead sea broke up,
For, Romney,angels are less tender-wise
For, though as powerless, said I, as a stone,
For, though I stood between her heart and heaven,
For,now He has left off calling firmaments

from
From alien lips which had no kiss for mine,
From all the various life of madrepores;
From all things upwards. I, Aurora, still
From any imperfect woman. Flower from root,
From any mortal drug. I have written truth,
From any narrow window on the street,
From any use that pleased him! He might cut
From April on to April went,
From brushing the twelve stones, for fear of some
From Burns, and Bunyan, Selkirk, and Tom Jones.
From chin-bands of the soul, like Lazarus,
From Chipewa to China; she requires
From Churchyard Elegies and Edens Lost,
From college times to these,as, going down hill,
From college to the country, very oft
From common sheep-paths, cannot help the crows
From conjurors? The child, there? Would you leave
From draughts in lobbies? Prejudice of sex,
From each man standing on the side of God,
From either cheek, my eyes globed luminous
From error on to error, every turn
From every glimmer on thy serpent-skin!
From every street and alley of the town,
From flower to flower, from snow to snow:
From flying over,were as natural still
From French engravings, nereids neatly draped,
From Giuliana. There was one, so old,
From Gods celestial crystals; all things, blurred
From green hills in advance of the white town,
From hand to hand, and yet from hand to hand,
From heat and noise!from those cicale, say,
From hells we preach of, with the flames blown out,
From henceforth for me! thou who hast, thyself,
From henceforth, thou and thine! ye are my own
From henceforth. Ah, youve written poems, sweet,
From henceforth. I am lonely in the world,
From henceforth. What we choose, may not be good;
From Horace, ‘Collegisse juvat, set
From hour to hour. I was not, therefore, sad;
From joys!to stand and claim to have a life
From Junos breasts, the broad Homeric lines,
From just a shadow on a charnel-wall,
From maize and vine until twas caught and torn
From many a volume, Love re-emphasised
From marble pale with beauty; then persist,
From Margarets Court at garret-height, to meet
From Marian, to his own prosperities,
From me, who scarce have money for my needs,
From mixing with the worlds prosperities;
From mortals over-bold. We sought the sense:
From mouth and cheeks, the whole childs face at once
From nature, as earth feels the sun at nights,
From nature, landscapes, rather say, washed out.
From obvious duties, and, depriving her,
From old Assuntas neck; how, with a shriek,
From out waste places comes a cry,
From pecking in her garden. Straw can fill
From possible communion. It may be.
From possible pulses; brown hair pricked with grey
From pulling at his sleeve and book and pen,
From putting vice down, with that womans toy,
From right to left, and then from left to right,
From saying ‘yes this morning. If you write
From seeing beautiful and cheerful sights,
From seeing judgment. Father, mother, home,
From sleep to sleep while Lucy slid away
From sliding headlong with the waterfalls
From softening in the pity of your case,
From speaking farther. You may tease, indeed,
From such a flowery creature,
From such a light as I could hold to her face
From such rough roots? the people, under there,
From such white heats!bucolics, where the cows
From telling Romney plainly, the designs
From that crammed mass! you did not usually
From that imputed ignominy, I made
From the day
From the empyreal, to assure their souls
From the highways dust. Or oft, the journey done,
From the old-spent wave. Such calm defiant looks
From the other barrel, tired of springeing game
From the top-nest in the neighbouring rookery
From their calm locks, and undiscomfited
From Vincent Carrington:‘My dear Miss Leigh,
From virile efforts! what cold wire-drawn odes,
From what he is, in his turn. Strain a step
From which long trail of chanting priests and girls,
From which the bas-relief and fresco have dropt:
From which the lichens scraped; and if St. Preux
From which the silken sleeps were fretted out,
From which the snuff being ousted by that shock,
From whom, and when? bring documents, prove dates.
From Zeuss thunder, who has ravished me

god
God answers sharp and sudden on some prayers,
God bids him speak, to prove what lies beyond
God claims his own, Divine humanity
God help me, but it made me arrogant;
God help you, you are groping in the dark,
God knows me, trusts me with the child! but you,
God love him! I should certainly be glad,
God meant me good, too, when he hindered me
God never hears your voice, excepting when
God save Eva's dog.
God sent her to his world, commissioned right,
God! A red nugget! A fat egg under a dog!
God! what face is that?
God, set our feet low and our forehead high,
god.
Gods being so definitely, that mans doubt
Gods grace to keep Gods image in repute;
Gods hand did interpose twixt it and me,
Gods lesson half, attaining as a dunce
Gods self would never have come down to die,
Gods silence on the outside of the house,
Gods triumph in them and supreme revenge,

Good acts by a great example twixt the extremes
Good Christians, who sate still in easy chairs,
Good cousin, therefore, both for her and you!
Good critics, who have stamped out poets hopes;
Good flesh-colour; I recognise my hand,
Good kings, who disembowelled for a tax;
Good looks, good means, and good digestion!ay,
Good night, Sir Blaise! Ah, Smithhe has slipped away
Good only, being perceived as the end of good,
Good painting thrown away. For me, Ive done
Good patriots, who, for a theory, risked a cause;
Good people. A good neighbour, even in this,
Good popes, who brought all good to jeopardy;
Good Sir Blaises brow is high
Good statesmen, who pulled ruin on the state;
Good things, not subtle, new yet orthodox,
good.

had
Had all this wrong of heart made sick the brain?
Had been unspoken; since she loves you well,
Had blown them all out when you spoke the same,
Had broken it in the lock as being too straight
Had burnt them larger, larger. And those eyes
Had caught me at my pastime, writing down
Had clapped together and utterly struck out
Had cured myself with gaping. As it was,
Had dazed the children when she threw them pence;
Had drawn the curtains of the world awhile
Had dropped,still throwing up splinters now and then,
Had fallen as thunder on a roaring fire,
Had fallen, and her future Lord
Had fed us fatter, therefore? we have climbed
Had filled up the whole valley to the brim,
Had found her in a ditch beneath the moon,
Had guessed as little of any human form
Had held up what is left to only one,
Had kept the mould oft.
Had left a longer weight upon my lips,
Had left her for a ruddier face than hers,
Had left them blank and flat so,drawing out
Had lived too long, though every muse should help
Had loved me coldly. If I thought so once,
Had loved my father truly, as she could,
Had made his heart beat fast enough for two,
Had made me oblivious of acquainting you
Had never changed the actual case for me.
Had set her own house all a-fire for me,
Had set me, on those mountain-peaks of hope
Had shown a gentler spirit, less arrogance,
Had shown me something which a man calls light:
Had spoken all in vain else.
Had thought of him who should be in a month,
Had touched the silver tops of heaven itself
Had trod me out, which suddenly broke off,
Had vainly interposed to put away,
Had warmed the place with ichor. Such Ive found
Had wiped out London,or as noon and night
Had worked more properly to buy me wine:
Had written his own letters, as he might,
Had wronged his tenants, robbed his native land,

half
Half agony, half ecstasy, the thing
Half awed, half melted,not being used, indeed,
Half blotted out of nature by a love
Half drunk across the beaker, with their eyes!
Half gibbering and half raving on the floor,
Half petulant, half playful, as we walked,
Half sad, half languid,like dumb creatures now
Half St. Giles in frieze
Half wishing they were dead to save the shame.

Has called us freely to work on with Him
Has chosen wisely.
Has done with keeping birthdays, saves her wreaths
Has dropped, and beats its shuddering wings,the lines
Has dropt wherever such a stem broke off,
Has fallen in May, and finds the whole earth warm,
Has leave to love you:while for me, alas,
Has made them so far-reaching: judge it ye
Has never hungered? Woe to him who has found
Has parted Leigh Hall into almshouses.
Has perished utterly as if we ate
Has promised,husk and chaff, the whole barley-corn,
Has quite got over that unfortunate ...
Has scarce seen really worse than some of us,
Has scorned to put her music in my mouth,
Has sent me in haste to find a cousin of mine
Has set to meditate mistaken work,
Has shone too straight upon his brain, I know,
Has stamped the honour of a patent act
Has struck down all my works before my face,
Has taken up the girl, and organised
Has turning acrid in six thousand years
Has twisted to a lighter absently
Has winked at such things, and weve all been young.
Has wronged my soul as this Aurora has,

Have died like Romans. I, in looking back,
Have failed too.
Have felt it hound me through the wastes of life
Have fly-leaves over-written by his hand,
Have learnt the simple dues of fellowship
Have made her, for your honourable wife?
Have meaning in them! theyre just blue or brown,
Have poets.
Have reached and pricked her heart, and, throwing flat
Have reason to be proud of our pure aims.
Have ruined no one through your dreams! Instead,
Have set me praying.
Have strung their losses on a rhyming thread,
Have taught me wrestling or the game of fives
Have vexed him. Also, when he found her set

he
He answered for me calmly, with pale lips
He answered gently, ‘Need you tremble and pant
He answered gently, ‘That is consequent:
He answered grave, ‘for necessary words,
He answered grave. ‘A reputable man,
He answered in a voice which was not his.
He answered mildly. ‘There is room indeed,
He answered sadly, ‘something, if but so.
He answered, ‘Be the summer ever green
He answered, ‘but it is:I take my wife
He answered, catching up my hands in his,
He answered,‘for the book is in my heart,
He answered.
He answered; ‘not of you, still less of me,
He baits with poisonous cheese, and lock us up
He bears down on me through the slanting years,
He blew me, plainly, from the crucible,
He bowed, we parted.
He breathed so near. The mother held her tight,
He breathing hot protesting vows of love,
He broke out ever like a flame at whiles
He broke the silence.
He came to tell me how the search advanced,
He came uncalled wherever grief had come.
He came with health recovered, strong though pale,
He cannot stand in with two stable feet.
He cannot stoop and take it.
He clears me therefore. What, ‘seduceds your word?
He could not have the trouble to be stirred,
He could not sleep for pastime? Nay, I swear
He could not touch her, so was tolerant
He counts it worthy. Thus, my father gave;
He cried, ‘and is it possible at last ...
He cried, ‘True. After Adam, work was curse;
He cried,‘O voice that speaks and overcomes!
He crossed the hills on visits to my aunt,
He does not curse his daughters in the least.
He doubts, is whether we can do the thing
He drew a chair beside me, and sate down;
He dropped a sudden hand upon my head
He dropped me long ago; but no one drops
He echoed, ‘that alas is all your word?
He echoed,‘Me! You sound it like a stone
He echoed,picking up the phrase beyond,
He echoed‘wife! mine! Lady Waldemar!
He ended. There was silence in the church;
He feels the inmost: never felt the less
He finds it easy, then, to clap thee off
He found a womans hand there, hed accept
He found she had received for visitors,
He gets a horse to use, not love, I think:
He gets his manhood plainest from his soul:
He grew so pale, dear, ... to the lips, I knew
He had a right to be dogmatical,
He had been away to visit in his sleep,
He had cared to try. She stood there with her great
He had crossed us out together with his sins.
He had laid his childish spelling-book and learned
He had loved me, watched me, watched his soul in mine,
He had made his Don a Donna.
He had stamped with steady hand Gods arrow-mark
He has always swum in;tis her element,
He has come to hope for others when they lose,
He has metamorphosed and converted her
He has to mount a stool to get at them;
He heareth the young ravens when they cry;
He held still, with his masterful pale face
He is not here; but far away
He leaves clean work behind him, and requires
He left our Florence, and made haste to hide
He lifted with a sudden word one day,
He liked it better than a better jest
He likes the poor things of the world the best;
He locks thee out at night into the cold,
He loved not Marian, more than once he loved
He loved so ...
He loves her then profoundly.
He loves Kate Ward, it seems, now, like a man,
He loves to make parade of pain
He loves you, Marian?
He made an almshouse of his heart one day,
He made quite other; while that moon He made
He may be childless also, like a man.
He may perhaps do for her such a thing,
He means to set you up, and comfort us.
He might have been a poet if he would,
He might have known, that, being what I was,
He might republic. Genuine government
He missed meay, and pelted very oft
He murmured,‘by so much less pitiable!
He murmured.
He musing somewhat absently perhaps
He must have touched me.‘Will you sit? I asked,
He never could be anything complete,
He never loved her,never. By the way,
He notched me with his tooth. But not a word
He paused there,and then, inward to himself,
He paused upon the word, and then resumed;
He plungesha! he has lost it in the splash.
He printed his discourses ‘by request;
He saddens, all the magic light
He said ... ‘Aurora, you are changedare ill!
He said ... ‘When I was last in Italy ...
He said at last,‘I came convicted here,
He said, ‘Twas kind, twas good, twas womanly,
He said, ‘it gleams so. Well, I wrung them out,
He said,with such a pity in his voice,
He said.
He said; ‘we boast, and do not. We put up
He sang perhaps, said Marian; ‘could she tell?
He saw his mothers face, accepting it
He says hell do it. After years of love,
He says hes hungry,he would rather have
He says it still of truth, which is His own.
He scarce would know it, if He looked this way,
He seeks to double himself by what he loves,
He seemed to sift me with his painful eyes.
He seems to have plucked a flower from the other side
He sent her to a famous sempstress-house
He sent the schools to school, demonstrating
He sets his virtues on so raised a shelf,
He sifted all the refuse of the town,
He sins so, to damn others with himself:
He smiled and loved me for the thing I was,
He smiled as men smile when they will not speak
He smiled so feebly, with an empty hand
He smiled so sternly that I spoke in haste.
He soured the proctors, tried the gownsmens wits,
He speaks, be quick with your obedience;
He stands on Rights side; never flinch for him,
He stepped on toward it, still with outstretched arms,
He still has sympathies beyond his creed,
He stood a moment with erected brows,
He stood and looked so.
He stopped and sighed. ‘That shall be presently,
He stopped me with a gesture of calm pride.
He stretched his arms out toward the thrilling voice,
He strode from side to side about the room,
He stroked his beardless chin ‘yes, plagued, sir, plagued:
He struck the iron when the bar was hot;
He sympathises rather with the fish
He talks of Florence,and may say a word
He taught me all the ignorance of men,
He thanked me, sighing ... murmured to himself,
He thinks he was not made to die;
He thought it should be so too, with his love;
He too received his sacramental gift
He took in change....
He touched the wounds of Christ,and made her feel
He turned and went abruptly, slammed the door
He turned his face upon me quick enough,
He turned his face upon me with its smile,
He turned instinctively,where, faint and fair,
He turned the tilting of the beam my way,
He was not angry that she had left the house
He was touched at once
He went on speaking.
He will not miss hereafter a pure home
He will not suffer the best critic known
He will work over us. Does He want a man,
He would have paused to ponder what he did,
He would have saved me utterly, it seemed,
He would not disconcert or throw me out;
He would not do it, moreover, to a Leigh,
He would not for the world: hes pitiful
He wrapt his little daughter in his large
He writes: mankind accepts it, if it suits,
He, ... Romney!
He, broken-hearted for himself and her,
He, by mans conscience, she, by womans heart,
He, maybe, got the upper hand of her
He, passionately loving, would bring down
Hed feel it bitter to be forced to miss
Hed look into my face, bark lustily,
Hed rail at Venus self for creaking shoes,
Hed say some folly ... that I loved the man,
Hed wash his hands in blood, to keep them clean.
Hell give her a week to die in. Pass the silk.
Hell have five thousand, and five thousand more,
Hell say his mother lived so contrary
Hell see it even by the starlight here;
Hell wrong the people and posterity
Hes ‘forced to marry where his heart is not,
Hes absolute on the figure, five or ten,
Hes best. Indeed he builds his goodness up
Hes better to us than many mothers are,
Hes just, your cousin,ay, abhorrently.
Hes orphaned haply. Here I take the child
Hes sad, I think you said,hes sick perhaps?
Hes satisfied with me, as I with him.
Hes stark!has turned quite lunatic upon

Her babe, ‘Youll touch that star, you think?
Her book-leaves, threw away the leaves that hurt,
Her broad wild woodland eyes shot out a light;
Her cameriera carried him, in hate
Her cheeks, and if she meant to lodge the birds
Her daughters headgear comb, let down the hair
Her duty to me, I appreciate it
Her duty, in large measure, well-pressed out,
Her eyelids with a real grave queenly look,
Her father earned his life by random jobs
Her filial and tormented heart, henceforth,
Her first cry in our strange and strangling air,
Her fountains in the sunshine from the squares,
Her Gian alive, and she herself eighteen.
Her gown of serge for that. The things we do,
Her great soul up into a great mans face,
Her hair with such a silver line as you,
Her head uncrushed by that round weight of hat
Her head, as queens may mock,then lifting up
Her heart was restless, pacing up and down
Her heart, against his words, beat out so thick,
Her heavy agate eyes which crushed my will,
Her heavy ringlets till they touched her smile,
Her hopes were building into with clay nests:
Her human testimonials fully signed,
Her individual life being stranded high
Her instincts holy,
Her larger sense of beauty and desire,
Her lips moved in a spasm without a sound,
Her loves a re-adjustment of self-love,
Her low voice singing to the child in bed,
Her maid must use both hands to twist that coil
Her memory for it. With three hundred pounds
Her mother had been badly beat, and felt
Her nail-mark even, where she took it up
Her neck takes: for she loves him, likes his talk,
Her newly-blossomed gladness in my face, ...
Her parents called her a strange, sickly child,
Her parents took her with them when they tramped,
Her pencil underscored this for a fault,
Her place is empty, fall like these;
Her poor signora. Therefore very strange
Her price paid down for knowledge, was to know
Her quadrant and armillary dials, black
Her quick gesticulation, wild yet soft,
Her secret from the latest moon?'
Her silver-laughone must be born to laugh,
Her smile was wonderful for rapture. ‘Thanks,
Her somewhat narrow forehead braided tight
Her sorrowful pleasures, till I felt ashamed.
Her thought of me,and drew my desk and wrote.
Her whole pale passionate face, mouth, forehead, eyes,
Her whole soul choked with curses,mad, in short,
Her words reproved me. This perhaps was love
Her yearling babe!youd face him when he wakes
her.

hi's
His bride of dreams, who walked so still and high
His brow would soften,and he bore with me
His cheeks all blurred with tears and naughtiness,
His cup, to fill with wine or vinegar,
His daughter, his and hers. Men do not think
His days were heavily taxed. Who buys a staff
His deep pathetic voice, as if he guessed
His eyes, the motions in his silent mouth,
His face towards the moon too.
His fathers shoes, he wears her husbands too:
His fathers uncles cousins second son
His feet, and flapped his eager arms like wings,
His filmed eyes fluttered by the whirling white
His foot pursued me down the stair. ‘At least,
His friend and cousin!so, you are safe. You two
His golden cross worn innermostly, carved
His hand and answering ‘Fly then, did not speak,
His heavy-shotted hammock-shroud
His help.
His large mans hands afraid to touch my curls,
His license in the field of time,
His love astray on one he should not love
His love, his life, his best, because the best
His marriage for a month.
His meaning hopeless;cry, that everywhere
His mother was the saddest creature born;
His name upon her ... it seemed natural;
His nose in profile, though you miss his chin;
His own heart climbing, panting in his throat
His own heavens pregnant with dynastic stars;
His pale lips fumbling for a sort of smile,
His pamphlets, pleas, and statements, everywhere?
His personal states condition honestly,
His phalansteries there, his speeches here,
His piteous words, his most pathetic words,
His porridge chiefly ... is it getting cold
His possible presence. Excellently well
His sidelong burnished head, in just her way
His sister, of the household precedence,
His speeches in the Commons and elsewhere
His stool, to sit on, or put up his foot,
His sun-skirts, through conventional grey glooms;
His teeth have crunched some foul unnatural thing:
His voice a little unsteady through his smile,
His voice along that silence, as he told
His voice dropped: I bent forward for the rest:
His voice in my ear, and mine to my own sense,
His voice rose, as some chief musicians song
His whole provisioned and complacent past
His wife is gracious, with her glossy braids,
His wife required no succour: he was bound
His wisdom is not worth the pin he wants.
His wrongs are so far back, ... he has forgot;
His yoke upon you and will learn of him,

how
How Adam lived in a garden. All the fields
How all those workers start amid their work,
How arrogant men are!Even philanthropists,
How bad those girls are! Oh, my flower, my pet,
How beautiful she looks, a little flushed!
How bitterly I speak,how certainly
How bright her life went, floating on her love,
How came you here alone?you are ignorant.
How dark I stood that morning in the sun,
How dreary tis for women to sit still
How far and safe, God, dost thou keep thy saints
'How good! how kind! and he is gone.'
How heavy it seemed! as heavy as a stone;
How I burn toward you? do you feel to-night
How it grinds and bruises!... if she loves at last,
How known, they know not,why, they cannot find,
How last I sate among them equally,
How long it seemed that moment. Oh, how far,
How lovely One I love not, looked to-night!
How many carats of fine gold made up
How many desolate creatures on the earth
How many weeks, I know not,many weeks.
How men are perjured when they swear our eyes
How much? how little? He would take no sign,
How nature tinged it first. Wellheres the true
How oft we throw it off and think,‘Enough,
How one was famished for her babys cheeks
How people, without mothers on the hills,
How sick we must be, ere we make men just!
How sickness ended very oft in heaven,
How strange his good-night sounded,like good-night
How sure it is,
How those gods look!
How vile must all men be, since hes a man.
How women can love women of your sort,
How, having lost her, sought her, missed her still,

I almost chanced upon a man I knew,
I almost snatched. I have a world to speak
I almost told her that you would not lose
I always thought so, angel,and indeed
I am changed since then, changed wholly,for indeed,
I am happy.
I am like,
I am not humbled to so low a point,
I am not old for nothing; I can tell
I am not on a level with your love,
I am sad.
I am well aware I do not derogate
I answered gaily, though my whole voice wept;
I answered gravely, ‘Poets needs must be
I answered mild but earnest. ‘I believe
I answered slow,as some wayfaring man,
I answered slowly; ‘you do well to name
I answered softly, ‘to a wrong youve done,
I answered then.
I answered with authority,‘I think
I answered, ‘since she fails to guess the cause
I answered, ‘that she loves you.Twas my turn
I answered, smiling gently. ‘Let it be.
I answered, trying to be cold.
I answered. ‘All that ruined world of yours
I answered. ‘If his mothers palms are clean,
I answeredburning through his thread of talk
I ask you,have we leisure, if we liked,
I ask you,would a girl go off, instead
I ask you? Did I ever ink my lips
I asked forsooth his pardon, and my own,
I blushed for joy at that‘The Italian child,
I blushed indeed, as if I loved the man,
I blushed.
I bowed my head, but found no word. Twas hard
I brand her therefore, that she took the child?
I break the spade off, digging deep for gold,
I breathe now; I spring upward like a branch,
I brim with sorrow drowning song.
I broke in at that.
I broke in. ‘You speak wildly, Romney Leigh,
I broke on Marian there. ‘Yet she herself,
I broke the copious curls upon my head
I broke through.
I brought in orderly to dine and sleep,
I but thank God who made thee what thou art,
I called the artist but a greatened man;
I came to do it with a sort of love,
I cannot call you slack in.
I cannot judge these tidesI shall, perhaps.
I cannot name it now for what it was.
I cannot see my road along this dark;
I cannot speak and burn you up between
I cannot tell you why it was. Tis plain
I cannot thank you for the good you did,
I cannot thoroughly love a work of mine,
I cannot write to Romney, ‘Here she is,
I cannot, in such beggared life, afford
I carried him and her to where I lived;
I catch this hand thats stretched to me and him,
I chanced to lift the cover count of all
I chanced upon the poets.
I charge you, be his faithful and true wife!
I choose to walk at all risks.Here, if heads
I choose, being kind, to write and tell you this
I clasped, as shipwrecked men will clasp a hand,
I clung to her. A moment, she seemed moved,
I comprehend a love so fiery hot
I comprehend your choiceI justify
I comprehended what he was in heart
I could but ill afford to let you be
I could call Marian, Marian, with the shriek
I could not be unthankful, I who was
I could not blame you. Then, you only seemed
I could not choose but fancy, half the way,
I could not choose but murmur to myself
I could not choose but take it on my arm
I could not do it, to save Romneys life;
I could not hurt you though I tossed my arms
I could not lift my heavy heart to breathe
I could not lose a sunset on the bridge,
I could not mean to tell her to her face
I could not, in so little, accept success,
I count it strange, and hard to understand,
I count that Heaven itself is only work
I cried, more angry that she melted me,
I danced the polka and Cellarius,
I dare forget I have you in my arms,
I dare not,though I guess the name he loves;
I dare not: tis too easy to go mad,
I dare say mentally he crunched the bones
I dare say; I have played at lions, too,
I dared to bid this angel take my part, ...
I dared to rest, or wander,like a rest
I did not die. But slowly, as one in swoon,
I did not live, to have the faults of life:
I did not love him ... nor he me ... thats sure....
I did not make it, to make light of it:
I did not need such safeguards:brutal men
I did not surely hate you yesterday;
I did not surely love him, took the word;
I did not write, nor read, nor even think,
I did some excellent things indifferently,
I did, did I?
I disbelieve in Christian-pagans, much
I do beseech you.
I do but sing because I must,
I do distrust the poet who discerns
I do not blame such women, though, for love,
I do not blame them, madam, nor misprize;
I do not contradict my thought of you
I do not hold the cords of such a net;
I do not love you. Ah well! catch my hands,
I do not suffer in a dream;
I do not think that any common she
I do remember clearly, how there came
I doubt your ablest mans ability
I drew breath
I dropped my horses bridle on his neck
I echoed thoughtfully‘The man, most man,
I envy not in any moods
I envy not the beast that takes
I envy you your mother!and you, Graham,
I failed. I throw the remedy back on God,
I fain would write it down here like the rest,
I fain would write. But if an angel spoke
I fancied I was poor.
I fear that I must sell this residue
I feared to jingle bells upon my robe
I feel as white and sulky as a ghost,
I feel content, so. You can bear indeed
I feel it, when I sorrow most;
I feel the brand upon my forehead now
I felt twas in you: yet I doubted half
I felt a mother-want about the world,
I felt him, rather than beheld him. Up
I felt it hard to breathe, much less to speak.
I felt no life which was not patience,did
I felt so young, so strong, so sure of God!
I felt the shame of compensated grief,
I felt the silent finger of his scorn
I felt the wind soft from the land of souls;
I felt, she too, had spoken words that night,
I find him worthier to be loved.
I find the world more sad and wicked fort.
I flattered all the beauteous country round,
I flung closer to his breast,
I followed up the stair upon her step.
I found a house, at Florence, on the hill
I found her wandering on the Paris quays,
I found my curse,in the gutter, with my shame!
I gamed a little, went to Paris twice;
I go to plant it on his tomb,
I grew next moment. As my blood recoiled
I had a father! yes, but long ago
I had a little chamber in the house,
I had brought to England my poor searching face,
I had done a duty in the visit paid
I had enough, there, of the lime, be sure,
I had ever come here in my perfect mind,
I had found the secret of a garret-room
I had grown distrustful of too forward Springs,
I had my windows broken once or twice
I had my wish,
I had no business with a sort of soul,
I had no glory in it. For the rest,
I had not been ungenerous on the whole,
I had not courage to be rightly true.
I had not seen him, youre aware, for long,
I had not thought of that, in all my thoughts,
I had owned a dog, I too, before my Troy,
I had read your shameful letter, and my heart.
I had relations in the Unseen, and drew
I had the news from Vincent Carrington.
I had thrown them there to keep them safe from Jove;
I had to live, that therefore I might work,
I had touched him. ‘Do you know her, he enquired,
I haply set you above love itself,
I hate; she will do nothing very well:
I have lost you!but I swear by all yourself,
I have my father,with my mothers face
I have no heart to pluck it with a blot.
I have not named my cousin hitherto,
I have not read a page of; but I toss
I have not so far left the coasts of life
I have not so much life that I should love,
I have not, without struggle, come to this.
I have so much. Observe, Aurora Leigh;
I have some worthy work for thee below.
I have to say against your cousins best!
I hear the bell struck in the night:
I hear the noise about thy keel;
I hear the soft child-breathing through the door;
I heard
I heard him say so; twas my recompence,
I heard my child cry in the desert night,
I heard so. And I cannot render right
I heard the broken words which Romney flung
I heard you speaking, ... friend!Confirm me now.
I held her two slight wrists with both my hands;
I held him fast upon it. ‘Mister Leigh,
I held in reverence. If he strained too wide,
I held it truth, with him who sings
I helped the frost with mine, and pained her more
I hold it true, whate'er befall;
I hold you will not compass your poor ends
I hold your hands, I look into your face
I hope it was not wicked to be glad.
I hoped this feeble fumbling at lifes knot
I interrupted,‘I had a cousin once
I interrupted; ‘if I loved you not,
I judged a strangers portrait and pronounced
I just knew it when we swept
I kept its pauses, marked its emphasis;
I kept the life, thrust on me, on the outside
I kissed the lips that ended.‘So indeed
I knew that Marian Erle was beautiful.
I knew them, though they had somewhat dwindled from
I know him push you forth as none of his,
I know I am not worthynay, in truth,
I know I have not ground you down enough
I know I never touched it.
I know it closer than another does,
I know it was not tendered nor received.
I know my cousin: Lady Waldemar
I know not if twas pity or twas scorn
I know not: yet I say as much as this
I know so much of love, as used to shine
I know that this was Life,the track
I know that we must scrupulously hint
I know that, now: youve been too patient, sweet.
I know we talk our Phædons to the end
I know youll not be angry like a man
I know your writing, Romney,recognise
I laboured on alone. The wind and dust
I lay, and spoke not. But He heard in heaven.
I learnt a little algebra, a little
I learnt cross-stitch, because she did not like
I learnt much music,such as would have been
I learnt my complement of classic French
I learnt so much at school, said Marian Erle.
I learnt the collects and the catechism,
I learnt the royal genealogies
I learnt to love that England. Very oft,
I leave this mortal ark behind,
I left off saying my sweet Tuscan words
I lifted up my voice and wept, and laughed,
I lifted up the curtains of the bed
I like him ... hes my friend. And all the rooms
I like such ivy; bold to leap a height
I liked to sit and watch would tremble out,
I loitered to my inn. O world, O world,
I looked for empire and much tribute, ‘Come,
I looked her in the eyes, and held her hands,
I looked into his face defyingly.
I looked up to feel
I looked upon the ground
I loosed her hands.‘In his name, no farewell!
I lose her. Yet I never forced her ‘ay,
I love you ... thats mere nature!you reject
I love you, loved you ... loved you first and last,
I love you, Romney.
I love you, Romney....
I love you. If I spoke untenderly
I love your cousin. If it seems unwise
I loved the weight I had to bear,
I loved you always, Romney. She who died
I made no answer. Had I any right
I make the birds singlisten!... but, for you,
I mean the new love this time, ... since last year.
I meant but only good. Perhaps I meant
I meet my lion simply as Androcles
I might have been a common woman now,
I might have held that poor child to my heart
I might sleep well beneath the heavy Seine,
I mind me, when we parted at the door,
I miss and love still. Dreadful!
I must beware the rather that I miss
I must not linger here from Italy
I need not farther bless you. If I dared
I never banged a child at two years old
I never blame the lady. Ladies who
I never could be happy as your wife,
I never could be harmless as your friend,
I never did: and, since youre proved so vile,
I never envied Graham his breadth of style,
I never liked the womans face, or voice,
I never liked you; which you knew so well,
I never will look more into your face,
I once began to tell you how she came,
I only thank the book for what it taught,
I ought to write to Romney, ‘Marians here.
I oust you from your fathers halls and lands,
I own heavens angels round her life suffice
I own myself excluded from being just,
I own that touched me.
I paused:
I played at art, made thrusts with a toy-sword,
I plungedI tore the crowd up, either side,
I pray you mark, was Lady Waldemar.
I pray you therefore to mistake me not,
I pray you!
I prayed her pardon, said, ‘I had little thought
I pressed in there; ‘The best men, doing their best,
I pressed, too, for the nude harmonious arm
I prosper, if I gain a step, although
I prosper. I but change my instrument;
I pulled the branches down,
I put in ‘yes or ‘no, I scarce knew why;
I quoted from them prettily enough,
I ran the whole quay down against their eyes;
I rather bring it to the witch.
I read a score of books on womanhood
I read books bad and goodsome bad and good
I read for hope. The path my fathers foot
I read much. What my father taught before
I read on calmly,calmly shut it up,
I read your book and loved it.
I recollect as, after fevers, men
I retain
I returned,‘Im glad of it;
I rode once to the little mountain-house
I rose, as if he were my king indeed,
I said, ‘my cousin? is the world so bad,
I said, ‘to raise them,this is human too;
I said, ‘you must have been most miserable
I said, so far, right, yes; not farther, though:
I said,‘Im thinking of a far-off June,
I sate alone, and drew the blessing in
I sate there musing, and imagining
I sate there, musing, till she touched my hand
I sate upon the deck and watched all night,
I saw at once the thing had witchcraft int
I saw her here, in Paris, ... and her child.
I saw him, mark you, but he saw not me
I saw his soul saw,‘Jasper first, I said,
I saw the whole room, I and Marian there
I saw you across the room, and stayed, Miss Leigh,
I say she died possessed of other sums.
I scarce could brook the strain and stir
I see the cabin-window bright;
I see the sailor at the wheel.
I seem to fail from out my blood
I seem to have missed a blessing ever since.
I seemed to care for hearing of that friend?
I seemed to feel a little like a Leigh,
I send it, tell him, for my marriage gift,
I sent a sidelong look to find his thought,
I set you on the level of my soul,
I shall not call unworthy, I, for one.
I shall not from the window of my room
I shant lose much by Lucy. Marian Erle,
I shaped the resolution to the act.
I should be glad, I think,
I should be joyful with the stream of joy
I should be sorry that you set me down
I should be very sorry not to hear:
I should have been a poet, only that
I should have died so, crushing in my hand
I should have thought ... a woman of the world
I should not feel it to be strange.
I should not, Marian, certainly be here.
I should not. I have kept, as others have,
I sighed. And he resumed with mournful face.
I sign.
I signed above, where all the stars were out,
I sing to him that rests below,
I sit within a helmless bark,
I slipped so quick behind the porphyry plinth,
I smiled for pity of them who pitied me,
I smiled that all this youth should love me,sighed
I sometimes hold it half a sin
I spare you common curses.
I speak of, ere the house was well awake,
I speak the names out sometimes by myself,
I speak, youll take the meaning as it is,
I still could bear it. Yet Im sorry, too,
I still heard singing on the shore! Deserved,
I stood alone i the belfry, fifty bells
I stood and trembled.
I stood myself there worthier of contempt,
I stood still, breathless, gazing, straining out
I stood there fixed
I stood there in the garden, and looked up
I stood up in the middle of the room,
I stood upon my deed and fought my doubt,
I stood upon the brink of twenty years,
I stoppedwe must stop somewhere. He, meanwhile,
I struggled for the posture of my soul
I struggled to precipitate myself
I struggled, ... never stopped to note the stakes
I surely, surely, should be very glad.
I swear I do not love him. Did I once?
I swept it backward as the wind sweeps flame,
I sympathise with all such things. But he
I take the grasses of the grave,
I talk of law! I claim my mother-dues
I tell her story and grow passionate.
I thank God I have found her! I must say
I thank Him quite out of the way of men,
I thank thee for that grace of thine!
I thank you for your generous cousinship
I thank you. Dear, be happy. Sing your songs,
I thank you. You are good as heaven itself
I think he had as excellent a sun
I think he had been standing in the room,
I think I could have walked through hell that day,
I think I did not give you anything;
I think I loved him not ... nor then, nor since....
I think I sate there silent, hearing all,
I think I see my fathers sister stand
I think I should be almost popular
I think I was a man for chiefly this;
I think Ive draped myself in womans pride
I think it frets the saints in heaven to see
I think it would not hurt nor trouble me.
I think the manly mouth just trembled. Then
I think the tears were in them, as he looked
I think they called malignant fays and imps
I think they let me go, when I was mad,
I think thou mockst me and my house, she said;
I think you had an English father, child,
I think you said my wife. He sprang to his feet,
I think youll find me sooner in my grave,
I think, myself, the second indicates
I thought a child was given to sanctify
I thought it did you good till now, but now ...
I thought my fathers land was worthy too
I thought not who commanded, caught me up
I thought so. All this anguish in the thick
I thought to tease you well, and fret you cross,
I thought youd one day draw a silken peace
I thought, ‘my father! O my fathers house,
I thought, ‘Now, if I had been a woman, such
I thought,Perhaps hes sliding now the ring
I threw it in a ditch to keep it clean
I threw my hunters off and plunged myself
I tie up ‘no upon His altar-horns,
I told him, as I tell you now, Miss Leigh,
I told you that I waked up in the grave.
I told your cousin, sir, that I was dead;
I took a chamber up three flights of stairs
I took a master in the German tongue,
I took him up austerely,‘You have read
I took the hand of....
I took the word up; ‘Never waste your wine.
I tore the meaning out with passionate haste
I tried to make my gs the way you showed.
I tried to take the cast-off life again,
I trust he lives in thee, and there
I turned the rein abruptly. Back we went
I understood her meaning afterward;
I used him for a friend
I used to get up early, just to sit
I used to liken, when I saw her first,
I walked on, musing with myself
I walked the day out, listening to the chink
I walked the narrow unrecognising streets,
I waltzed with you three hours back. Up at six,
I wander, often falling lame,
I want good counsel. Will you lend me wings
I wanted time,and gained it,wanted you,
I was a worm too, and he looked on me.
I was but only yours,upon my knees,
I was glad, that day;
I was not backward.
I was not changed? the same Aurora? Ah,
I was not ever, as you say, seduced,
I went by road and village, over tracts
I went with reeling footsteps down the stair,
I went?... and of a letter, yesterday,
I wept aloud, then laughed, then wept, then wept,
I wept so? Did I drop against his breast,
I will but blow my whistle toward the lane,
I will not ask you what your feeling is
I will not eat this corn, nor drink this wine,
I will not let thy hideous secret out
I will not say there are not, young or old,
I will not scorn her, after all, too much,
I will not vex you any more to-night;
I will not write to Romney Leigh.
I will write no plays.
I wish you joy, Miss Leigh.
I wish you well through all the acts of life
I with it; for I long to prove
I woke, rose up ... where was I? in the world;
I wonder if Brinvilliers suffered more
I wonder if Pygmalion had these doubts,
I wonder you should look me in the face,
I wonder, that youd have my business out
I worked my rhythmic thought, and furrowed up
I worked on, on.
I worked the short days out,and watched the sun
I worked with patience which means almost power.
I would be a dog for this, to know it at last,
I would have seen thee sooner, Italy,For
I would not be a rose upon the wall
I would not be a woman like the rest,
I would not condescend ... we will not say
I would not dare to call my soul my own,
I would not do, ... not for my life ... nor him ...
I would not have you thinking, when Im gone,
I would not push my darling to a stool
I would not say sobut for him. He limps
I would not therefore, if I could, be rich.
I would that you could see me bare to the soul!
I would that, Romney, I could name your wife
I write a word, and counteract this sin.
I write so
I write. My mother was a Florentine,
I wrote for cyclopædias, magazines,
I wrote in answer‘We, Chaldeans, discern
I wrote my letter which delivered him
I wrote? ‘defiled I thought her? Stoop,
I yield; you have conquered.
I, alas,
I, falling on his faithful heart,
I, from my superabundance,from your want,
I, Marian Erle, myself, alone, undone,
I, now, love Romney. You put up your lip,
I, peradventure, have writ true ones since
I, ready for confession,I was wrong,
I, too, at first desponded. To be blind,
I, too, have my vocation,work to do,
I, too, sate quiet, satisfied with death,
I, too, see somewhat, though I cannot sing;
I, who should have known,
I, writing thus, am still what men call young;

Im somewhat dull still in the manly art
Im speaking from a false humility.
Im still too young, too young, to sit alone.
Im talking garlic.
Im tender; Ive no stomach even for beef,
Im thinking, Romney, how twas morning then,
Im very happy that you like my book,
Im warm, and cold, and hungry, and afraid,
Im writing like a poet, somewhat large
Im young in age, and younger still, I think,
Ive been to see his work ... our work,you heard
Ive come here, as the lion-hunters go
Ive envied; but for this,that when, by chance,
Ive had so many birthdays since that day,
Ive heard of. Not to undervalue them,
Ive heard such things and pondered. Did I indeed
Ive known the pregnant thinkers of this time,
Ive learnt to prize mirths opportunities,
Ive let them out, my Kates! Ive painted her,
Ive pondered much a certain thing she asked ...
Ive room for no more children in my arms;
Ive seen some men, veracious, nowise mad,
Ive seen them writing, when I brought a dress
Ive seen upon the mountains of Vaucluse,
Ive seen you weeping for a mouse, a bird,
Ive set myself to art! What then? whats done?
Ive sorely failed; Ive slipped the ends of life,
Ive surely failed, I know; if failure means
Ive waited near an hour fort. Pardon me,
Ive waked and slept through many nights and days
Ive writ all night,

if
If all was good and fair we met,
If any calm, a calm despair:
If artist-born? O sorrowful great gift
If bettered in its many. We, indeed,
If but one angel spoke from Ararat,
If cousin Romney pleased to walk with me.
If day by day he had to bend his height
If earnest will, devoted love, employed
If even a little better, ... still, what then?
If feeble, thus to justify his match.
If genuine artists, witnessing for Gods
If girls must talk upon their birthdays. Come,
If God is not too great for little cares,
If God please. Thats wrong thinking, to my mind,
If God stood near me, and beheld his heaven
If haply youre the wife of Romney Leigh,
If hard to me, heroic for himself!
If He once, in the first creation-week,
If He spoke
If he was happy, since he made her so,
If I said ‘father. Now I might cry loud;
If I, Aurora, can have said a thing
If I, that day, and, being the girl I was,
If I, the poets veritable charge,
If ill-accounted, then accounted ill;
If life-bloods fertilising, I wrung mine
If life-bloods necessary,which it is,
If Lucy here ... sir, Lucy is the corpse ...
If marriage be a contract, look to it then,
If Mister Leigh had chosen a wife from these,
If mortals were not greater by the head
If music had but one note and was sad,
If no considerate hand should tie a blind
If no friend, what forbids to make a friend
If no wind tears them; but, let summer come,
If not for me, my sister.
If not here, there perhaps. Then, drawing breath,
If not melodious, do you play on me,
If not so lamentable! Its the way
If nothing else. And yet twas dangerous.
If now youd stoop so low to take my love,
If once corrected by the thing I know,
If once or twice I let my heart escape
If once rung on the counter of this world;
If one should bring me this report,
If one should see not what the other saw:
If out I threw it past the cypresses,
If peradventure you would hide a thing.
If shes the saint to curse by, let us leave
If sick, if vexed, if dumb, a silver-piece
If somewhat slack in new philanthropies;
If steel had offered, in a restless heat
If still, to run on straight a sober pace
If such a letter were prepared in time.
If such as I came in with outstretched hand,
If such as I, might grow upon the hills;
If such he had known,most like a shipwrecked man
If tanks were clearer. Let us clean the tubes,
If that June-morning had not failed my hope,
If that od-force of German Reichenbach
If that same golden moon were overhead
If that were credible, being scarcely spoilt,
If thats your way! but sometimes slumber too,
If thats your way, poor insect. That's your way!
If then adopted, had displeased us more
If this be pity, tis so for myself,
If this then be success, tis dismaller
If this went on!I ripped my verses up,
If thus you have caught me with a cruel springe?
If veritable and lawful, is not given
If virtue done for popularity
If you and I remained still you and I,
If young men of your order run before
If, careful for that outcast child of mine,

In a better cause.
In a dark slow stream, like blood. To see that sight,
In a dream. Books, pictures,ay, the pictures! what,
In a moments sweep of eyesight, and I stood
In a mounting whirlwind of dilated flame,
In a perfect chord of love; and so, Mark Gage.
In a sacrament of souls? with mothers breasts,
In a universal pruriency,the thing
In acquiescent shadow murmurously:
In adoration, at the picture there,
In all a childs astonishment at grief
In all our life. A handful of the earth
In all that clang and hewing out of men,
In all that hair; and then they lifted her,
In all the earth and heavens too?
In all this unroofed and unfurnished world,
In all your other books, I saw but you:
In alternation with the large black fly
In answering also, if youll question me,
In any mans breast, looking presently
In any sisters virtue! while they keep
In any woman, I scarce marvel much
In apparition on the golden sky
In Arno like a sheaf of sceptres, left
In art, in morals, or the social drift,
In arts pure temple. Must I work in vain,
In autumn-gusts, seen dark against the sky:
In being so little modest: a dropped star
In being so peevish with me? You, at least,
In being too happy? would she set me straight?
In bitter vinegar.
In bluenot purple! thats the dowager.
In braids, because she liked smooth-ordered hair.
In broken words like these‘No need to wait.
In casting back with all my strength and will
In change for heaven itself, with such a smile
In church and street, and then returned alone
In close-approaching advent, not discerned,
In college-learning, law, and parish talk,
In colonising beehives.
In coming hither I mistook the way.
In daring to look down upon ourselves!
In digging vineyards, even: books, that prove
In divine languor he, the man, appeared
In doubt twixt dark and bright, nor left you clear
In each orbed bulb-root of a general truth,
In England we were scarce acquaintances,
In England, for so much even,though, of course,
In England, no one lives by verse that lives;
In England, we fall headlong. Heres a sight,
In every limb, aspires in every breath,
In every uncertain distance, till, at last,
In expectation of a guest;
In faded notes as thick and fine and brown
In feeling what a little thing is man:
In fellowship and mateship, as a child
In fiery swirls of slime,such strangled fronts,
In finer motions of the lips and lids.
In Florence, where he had come to spend a month
In forcing crooked creatures to live straight;
In full front sun-face, and your eyelids wink
In galley-couplings or in marriage-rings,
In glosing gifts;but I, who share your blood,
In God, for your part?ay? that He who makes,
In God,work, worship ... therefore let us pray!
In gorgeous sweeps of scorn. We all begin
In gradual progress like another man,
In haste I tore the phrase.
In heaps of fury, rend it, swallow it up
In heats of terror, haste, victorious joy,
In Heavens white judgment-book, to marry ... ah,
In her deep self, than some dead lake
In her last kiss, upon the baby-mouth
In her own word as spoken to herself
In high companionship. So, happiest!
In his high conscience, if the things should be,
In his second grave beneath the golden dome
In hope and in illusion, when I took
In innocent and indolent repose;
In isolated self-love and self-will,
In Joves clenched palm before the worlds were sown,
In keeping back from telling you the truth:
In lashing off the flies,didactics, driven
In leaping through the palpitating pines,
In learned modulation phrased itself
In letting go a friend of mine, who came
In life, in art, in science, but she fears
In lip and life, till now: I wept a week
In literary toil.Youll like to hear
In looking down
In love and sorrow. She had pored for years
In loving Romney Leigh. The name is good,
In loving such an one.
In loving wishes to your house.
In luxury of emotion. Something less
In Lyons velvet,we are not, for that,
In making England! such an up and down
In manner of an accusation, thus.
In manner of their fleece at shearing-time.
In marriage,able to revive, return
In marrying and being married, just the same
In measure to the proclive weight and rush
In melancholy patience, not unkind,
In Melbournes poor-bills, Ashleys factory bills,
In mine, and let us blossom for the world
In more of life true life no more
In much? you said so. I was wrong in most.
In my ears
In new dynasties of the race of men,
In no ones honour which another keeps,
In one of your fixed thoughts ... which put me out
In one, to call your name, enquire your where,
In order to discover the Muse-Sphinx,
In order to light men a moments space.
In order to reach up unto that higher;
In order to see nearer. Let us pray
In pangs and pity. Let me speak and die.
In pants and pauses. What an ugly crest
In Paris. Theres a silk, for instance, there,
In Paris; they had turned me up in vain
In park or street,he leaning on the door,
In personal presence, or but testify
In pity of what I am.
In pity on their fathers being so dull,
In place of colours; we are now grown cold,
In poets lore and charming reverie,
In putting questions, madam, I replied.
In quaintly dear contracted Grecian types,
In recognition. Now, a fantasy,
In riding from the town.
In riding through the village. ‘There he goes,
In Romney Leigh; the thing was surea friend,
In Santa Croce to her memory,
In saying bluntly, venturing truth on love,
In schemes of ... ‘Here well go, and ‘There well stay,
In search of her own beautys pearl: while I....
In setting right societys wide wrong,
In short soft lapses of transported flame
In shout and laughter, stripping all the boughs
In Shropshire, to the famed phalanstery
In sight of ends. To-morrow: no delay.
In sight of men and women, for your child,
In silence, as a creature might, who gazed:
In silks from Tarsus, shrieking east and west
In smiling; cheeks, in which was yet a rose
In social problems,as you tie your rhymes,
In some brown moth. Be, rather, bold, and bear
In some divine and fluttering pity.
In some fair garden; though the creatures fond
In some full wine-cup, over-brims the wine!
In some transformed, apocryphal, new voice,
In somewhat stronger wine than any sipped
In speaking of a future book of mine,
In speaking of my cousin.
In speaking, which confused the sense of much;
In spite of gasps? Well, naturally you think
In spite of long walks on the windy hills.
In sport, not pride, to learn the feel of it,
In still March-branches, signless as a stone:
In still new worlds?with summer-days in this,
In such a cheerful twitter of rapid speech,
In such a curl of hell-foam caught and choked,
In such a laugh, their fatal weeds of love!
In such a little tremour of the blood
In such a safe despair, I left the thing.
In such a social strait? The common blood
In sudden shame that I should hear her laugh,
In tamarisk-leaves and myrtle. Im so sad,
In tesselated order, and device
In that case,and the noble house of Leigh
In that descriptive poem called ‘The Hills,
In that extremity of love, twill pass
In that face and another. Just so much;
In that first onrush of lifes chariot-wheels,
In that great square of the Santissima,
In that new church for which the worlds near ripe,
In that pernicious prison of Leigh Hall
In that poor room so cold and orderly,
In that white face, ... till some one caught me back,
In that, I am never caught at fault or doubt.
In the act and aspiration. She felt his,
In the act. Your city poets see such things,
In the agonising present.
In the beginning when God called all good,
In the childs riot. Still I sit and feel
In the ducal reservoir she calls her line
In the dust of the racing chariots!
In the face of Heaven, ... which blenched, and ran up higher.
In the grass beside her,turning out the red
In the open squares of Paris!
In the smooth fair mystery of perpetual Life.
In the type of the image,and exaggerate
In the water-torture, ... flood succeeding flood
In these new, just, administrative times
In these things. What we are, imports us more
In thickets, and eat berries!
In this bad, twisted, topsy-turvy world,
In this beleaguered earth, for head and heart,
In this cold land of England. What you love,
In this disjointed life, for one wrong more.
In this drained water-course, and, letting flow
In this inferior nature,or, ourselves,
In this Medæan boil-pot of the sun,
In this mixed world, and fasten it for once
In this poor world. We talk by aggregates,
In this Spring air,I punish her for that?
In this uneven, unfostering England here,
In this world! Then I spoke,‘I did not think,
In this world,tis the best you get at all;
In this; and now hes lost! through me alone!
In those days, though, I never analysed
In those deserted walks, may find
In those devouring mirrors. Through the grate,
In those green country walks, in that good time,
In those old days of Shropshire,pardon me,
In those old days, than seems to suit you now:
In thought or vision, if attainable,
In thunder, should we, haply, know much more
In token of the harvest-time of flowers?
In tongue-tied Springs,and suddenly awoke
In trance, to attain to clairvoyance,and still
In trust for that Australian scheme and me,
In Tuscan fashion,her full ebon eyes,
In upright consciousness of place and time,
In vain; a favourable speed
In voluble excuses,obviously
In vortices of glory and blue air.
In what a dreadful trap his creature here,
In which a hundred fields might spill their dew
In which absorbed, loss, anguish, treasons self
In which fantastic mood I bounded forth
In which he has planted out his sapling stocks
In which her little feet winked overhead
In which his breath was; while the golden moon
In which long wanderings, Marian lived and learned,
In which the blood of wretches pent inside
In which the fibrous years have taken root
In which the mystic obelisks stand up
In which the ugly silkworms hide themselves.
In which they have wrapt earths foundlings, heavens elect!
In which we two were wont to meet,
In which, if I should read a page or two,
In whom the entail now merges by the law.
In whose most prodigal eyes, the lineal pearl
In wishing him most happy. Now he leaves
In wishing you unmitigated good,
In witnessing he loved her.
In words, like weeds, I'll wrap me o'er,
In years, I mixed, confused, unconsciously,
In your sense I am not solet it pass.
In youth like mine, would fail to raise me up,
In youths fine linen and fair broidery,
in.

Is ‘sorry, and Im sorry; but hes strong
Is a great ear-trumpet for the deaf as posts,
Is any creature, because gone to God?
Is any shrewder trick upon the cards
Is apprehended as the bare result
Is bad: a naughty mother!
Is better for a mans soul in the end,
Is born in ignorance of his element,
Is but a small thing to the love of one.
Is but a word in Art, which soon grows cramped,
Is but the expression of a nation, good
Is but the expression of mens single lives,
Is certain. Stye or no stye, to contrive
Is dash'd with wandering isles of night.
Is delicate with some last starry touch,
Is destined to solution. Authorised
Is edged from elemental fire to assail
Is eloquent as if you were not dumb;
Is ended, without waiting for a wife
Is fatal sometimes,cuts your morning up
Is fatal,foolish too. King Arthurs self
Is flat and quiet, as a decent grave;
Is found, and finds her home with such a friend,
Is given in outline and no more.
Is glad of such a creed! an artist must,
Is God a consideration?she loves you,
Is greater than the womans of the man,
Is hard upon them when they miss the church
Is here, she said, and signed upon the child.
Is in the judgment only, which yet stands;
Is inappreciable;no beauty or power!
Is it so?
Is just being tortured. If she said a word,
Is just that such as she, with such as I,
Is like a prayer ... with God.
Is merely passive, does not retro-act,
Is next best? A potential love, forsooth!
Is no one to have holidays but you?
Is not a book. Alas, the best of books
Is not a woman, Romney, but a cause:
Is not so high, but I so low, instead;
Is not the best for,nor your love the best,
Is not the imperative labour after all.
Is now contented. From his personal loss
Is no-wise right. Theres one true thing on earth;
Is on the skull which thou hast made.
Is on the waters day and night,
Is one thing, England one.
Is open to you, cousin. I go hence
Is out of date, like Adams. Set a swan
Is paralyticthats the reason why
Is praise of all kinds but to such a use
Is pulling its high cap down on its eyes,
Is quick with yours, since, just a fortnight since,
Is rapid for a poet who bears weights
Is Romney Leigh, you understand.
Is Romney Leigh; although the sun of youth
Is royal, and to sign it like a queen,
Is rustling to our ankles in dead leaves.
Is sadder than a burial-day of kings.
Is scarce a wife for Romney, as friends judge,
Is scarce advanced to see as far as this,
Is scarce worth running fast for, and youd gain
Is seen, but sees not.
Is something awful which one dares not touch
Is soon about to marry.
Is still more potent than a poetess,
Is sure to come too late for more good-days:
Is talked of as the future wife of Leigh,
Is thirty thousand. You will have it paid
Is this French people.
Is this the end of all my care?'
'Is this the end? Is this the end?'
Is torn alike. I sometimes touched my aim,
Is vocal in its wooded walls;
Is what I dare not,though some royal blood
Is womanly, past question.
Is worthy, but so given to entertain
Is wrong, in short, at all points. We divide
Is yours, my cousin. Poets become such,
is.

It also, peradventure, may outgrow
It always makes me sad to go abroad;
It burns its natural veil of august shame,
It burns, it burntmy whole life burnt with it,
It came in softly, while the angels made
It cannot be; it shall not. Fame itself,
It comforts me entirely for your fame,
It floats up, it turns over in my mind,
It had not been, but that I felt myself
It had not hurt me. Ah, youll not mistake
It is not gathered as a grain of sand
It is not good for man to be alone,
It is not my case. And this special book,
It is not part of your philosophy
It is not wholesome for these pleasure-plats
It is strange,
It is that he may verily be great
It knows not. I, Aurora Leigh, was born
It left behind it in a last months grave,
It lived, it alsocertes incomplete,
It made him easier to be pitiful,
It made me tremble if she touched my hand;
It may be, I am colder than the dead,
It means more than it saystis damnable!
It might feel somewhat liker to a crown,
It might have steadied the uneasy breath,
It must be. Arts the witness of what Is
It never look'd to human eyes
It passes in its place, indeed,which means
It pleasures him to stoop for buttercups;
It pushes toward the intense significance
It seemed to fill her body; then it burst,
It seemed, like others,only not in heaven.
It seems as if I had a man in me,
It seems I shall be lost too, presently,
It seems unnatural drinking.
It sets ours beating. This is living art,
It smelt like blessed entrails? such a dream
It soothed her more than her own tears,‘poor child!
It sounded as an instrument thats played
It spoils me for the smiling of the rest
It stands above my knowledge, draws me up;
It strikes us,thats our fancy.‘When I asked
It takes the ideal, to blow a hairs-breadth off
It takes the ideal, to blow an inch inside
It takes to move a woman: let her start
It touched her strangely. ‘Marian Erle, called kind!
It tried her, when she had learnt at Sunday-school
It turned with.
It turns by sunset to a withered leaf.
It was as if a meditative man
It was as if he spoke, and when he spoke
It was as if I had held my hand in fire
It was most precious, standing on his shelf,
It was not so with us, indeed. While he
It was not tendered. By a word she dropped,
It was not to take honour, but give help;
It was the hour for angelsthere, stood hers!
It will be hard,' they say, `to find
It wipes me clean and sweet from devils dirt,
It would be dreadful for a friend of yours,
It would have pleased me better as a hope,
It would not mix its tenses. I was past,
It would not shift our places as mere friends,
it.
Its death to me. Observe,it had not much
Its nought to Marian if hes sad or sick.
Its something awful. We had pardoned him
Its yours, the book; Ill write your name in it,

Its delicate white vans against the sky,
Its gall and rags even. Bubbles round a keel
Its money-value. So, Leigh gives to Leigh
Its phrasèd thunders;these things are no more,
Its regal neck, and learns to carry and fetch
Its shifting fancies and celestial lights,
Its string with the weight of roses overblown,
Its sweetness comes the next to what you speak

Just after I had writ to you in France,
Just capable of one heroic aim,
Just choked with sand, returns, for building towns!
Just gasps of make-believe galvanic life;
Just here! But nofor your sake ...
Just I ... the conscious and eternal soul
Just motioned for the smile and let it go:
Just murmuring an excusing word she passed
Just nothing to you. Why, I call you hard
Just one, beloved, I am in no wise changed:
Just sailing upward from the red stiff silk
Just so for ever, sweetest friend, he said,
Just so. But, cousin, shall I pardon you,
Just so. Shell make a nosegay of her words,
Just then, the girl stopped speaking,sate erect,
Just touch some face more lifted, more in need,
Just waves her head, as if a flower indeed,

Less aspectable, by half, too.
Less bitter with me, for ... in short, he said,
Less blindly. In my ears, my fathers word
Less blue than radiant. From the outer wall
Less costly to me than the cheapest here;
Less mapping out of masses, to be saved,
Less sacrifice, more appetite. At which

Let all that noise go on upon his back:
Let darkness keep her raven gloss:
Let go conventions and sprang up surprised,
Let heaven look to it,I am not afraid,
Let knowledge grow from more to more,
Let Love clasp Grief lest both be drown'd,
Let me draw Lord Howe;
Let O'Hara gain an inn in a Niagara hotel.
Let others miss me! never miss me, God!
Let out into that terrible street alone
Let pass the rest, then; only leave my oath
Let pass! I did not filch ... I found the child.
Let sinners look to it.
Let suddenly on sick eyes.
Let that be. We are sad to-night, I saw,
Let that pass too.
Let us go.
Lets hope he gave her a loaf too, within reach,

Like a coal dropt and forgot on tapestry,
Like a face on water, to beget itself.
Like a fallen star, upon so high a point,
Like a mans cheek laid on a womans hand;
Like a netted lioness? ist my fault, mine,
Like a nightmare. There are fatal days, indeed,
Like a shot bird. Youths stern, set face to face
Like a torch quenched in falling. Down she sank,
Like a white soul tossed out to eternity
Like an untamed hawk upon a strong mans fist,
Like any other anthill. Born, I say;
Like any pedant. Is the blue in eyes
Like any plain Miss Smiths, who wears a front;
Like Atlas, in the sonnet,and support
Like blessedest St. Lucy, on a plate,
Like Cæsars chariot weighing half a ton
Like cast-off nosegays picked up on the road,
Like coarsest clothes against the cold:
Like dull narcotics, numbing pain.
Like fingers of some ghastly skeleton Hand
Like grasshoppers at Athens, and skip thrice
Like graves dug side by side, at measured lengths,
Like her I go; I cannot stay;
Like her Im meaning,centre to herself,
Like Jacobs white-peeled rods before the rams;
Like lilies from the rocks, from hers and his,
Like looking at a sunset full of grace
Like many half as wise. The thing I mean
Like Marian, with that crown of prosperous wives,
Like men of the west instead of Adams corn
Like moly? will the apple die out too?
Like one in anger drawing back her skirts
Like one who wakens in a grave and shrieks,
Like one you wore once; tis a little frayed;
Like other creatures, craving offal-food,
Like other false worksIll not ask for grace,
Like other fire-flies, and amazed the pit:
Like other parents, in the factories;
Like other rich men, for a drop of dew
Like other women of my class,but now
Like others of my sort; the bed was laid
Like Pharaohs armaments in the deep Red Sea,
Like plumes, as if man made them,tossing up
Like red-hot devils crinkled into snakes,
Like rosemary smells, a movement will shake out
Like sea-weed on the rocks, and suffer her
Like Shakspeare and the gods. Thats very hard.
Like shot from guns. On, on. And now she had cast
Like so much chaff, whichever way they blow,
Like some Druidic idols fiery brass,
Like some ill scholars scrawl from heart and slate,
Like some lost book we dropt in the long grass
Like some poor curious bird, through each spread wing
Like some small nimble mouse between the ribs
Like some tormented scorpion. Then, at last,
Like some unhappy verdict. That I failed,
Like swallows, which the exasperate, dying year
Like that Aurora Leighs.
Like that tear, sweetest. I am quiet now,
Like these Ive read, and yet dissimilar,
Like thesethe times you made me weep for joy
Like those hot fire-seeds of creation held
Like those the boys sang round the holy ox
Like wax the azure spaces, could they force
Like wet sea-weed. You dimly see her through
Like wicks the housewives send afloat on oil,
Like wild swans hid in lilies all a-shake.

made
Made atheist by suggestion; moral books,
Made cool the forehead with fresh-sprinkling dreams,
Made firewood for his sake, and flaming up
Made haste to place me by the altar-stair,
Made right to suckle babes ... she took me off,
Made sudden heats. And when at last I came,
Made sweeter for the step upon the grass,

Makes stedfast face against the bitter wind.

may
May a moody baby doom a yam?
May blow the plague in her protesting breath
May call his choice most worthy.
May find you doubtful. Write a word for Kate:
May God save France!
May joy be with them! she has chosen well,
May learn to feel on still through these to those,
May lose, as he does. Theres an end to all,
May make one music as before,
May never mean enough to ruffle me.
May not catch something of the bloom and breath,
May praise her for it. Meantime, some of us
May pull down to his level, in search of nuts,
May touch the impress with reverent hand, and say
May warm audacious hands in passing by.

m'en
Men call that name!
Men carry a corpse thus,past the doorway, past
Men clamour for an order of merit. Why?
Men get opinions as boys learn to spell,
Men usefullest i the world, are simply used;
Men work here, only,scarce begin to live:
Men, if true poems: and who dares exclaim

Might beat against the impervious doors of heaven,
Might choose to build in, though the nest itself
Might end concisely,but I failed to die,
Might feel my loveshe was his sister once
Might make us, each to either, insecure,
Might reach the lowest trail of blossoming briar

more
More and more, from the first similitude.
More calmly and more carefully than so,
More courteous than was tender, gave me still
More freely when, the mistress turning round,
More fully than the special outside plans,
More gems, more glory,to consume entire
More gently, cousin, than you ever will!
More highly fatal?
More highly mated. He has shot them down,
More justly, thats more humbly, of myself,
More knowledge of the bounds in which we work;
More knowledge that each individual man
More or lessand Im sorrywhich is all
More passion.
More self-respecting. Hope, he called, belief
More slowly than I verily write now,
More testimony to convict a thief?
More than my brothers are to me.
More utterly irremediable. And since
More utterly shut out from me, I felt,
more.

most
Most charitable sir,feel ill at ease,
Most happy; and the good he meant the world,
Most ignorant of the special words of such,
Most like some passive broken lump of salt
Most like some prisoned lion sprung awake,
Most naturally unwilling to be tamed,
Most noble Romney, wed a noble wife,
Most passionately patient, waited on,
Most serious work, most necessary work,
Most unheroic. Ours, for instance, ours!
Most women of your height even counting love

much
Much fitter for his handmaid than his wife,
Much less a friend ... except that youre misled
Much less a greater secret; curtainless,
Much less a woman, think you? Every time
Much less Aurora. Ah, my sweet, come down,
Much less in Nephelococcygia,
Much less to you? he did not say twas well,
Much rather than I read it. Thus it ran.

must
Must brave it. Pardon, Lady Waldemar!
Must come to me from those who love me not,
Must fail to unmake her, for my honoured wife.
Must fall like dead leaves trodden underfoot
Must fill up his capacity for joy.
Must go to a perfect cosmos. Natural things
Must go together. And this Proclus too,
Must grow together like the tares and wheat
Must henceforth with its good roof shelter you:
Must keep me deaf to music.
Must leave irreparable rags without.
Must melt down golden pieces in the nard
Must never, never, never join hands so.
Must quicken, and increase to multitude
Must see it again, ... will see it, by my hopes
Must sell at tallest sum
Must sin have compensations, was my thought,

my
My aggrandisement: theres no room left for me,
My answer to her accusation?‘Yes,
My arms up, like the caryatid, sole
My Arthur, whom I shall not see
My aunt possessed this sum,inherited
My ballads prospered; but the ballads race
My best Aurora, though I saw your eyes,
My birthday.
My blessing, like a line of light,
My blood swam, my eyes dazzled. Then I sprang
My blue eyes greatening in the looking-glass,
My body into coins to give away
My book, but not my heart; for recollect,
My books price with the publisher, direct
My books!
My brothers daughter has dismissed my guests?
My cheeks had pined and perished from their orbs,
My child-heart gainst the thorny underwood,
My childhood backward in a childish jest
My childish imagery,and kept in mind
My choice, my ends, my motives, nor myself:
My Cloud,to go before me every day
My cousin and friend! my helper, when I would,
My cousin met me with his eyes and hand,
My cousin Romney gathered with his hand
My cousin Romney would have said such words
My cousin Romney?this is wonderful.
My cousin! that I have seen you not too much
My cousin!
My cousin, as the honour of us both,
My cousin, you had ever known Kate Ward.
My cowslip-ball! weve done with that cross face,
My critic Belfair wants another book
My critic Hammond flatters prettily,
My critic Jobson recommends more mirth,
My critic Stokes objects to abstract thoughts;
My daily bread tastes of it,and my wine
My deed gave way beneath me suddenly,
My deeper anguish also falls,
My dreary face against a dim blank wall
My eagle, with both grappling feet still hot
My elder by few years, but cold and shy
My eyes and forehead answered for my face.
My face,I must have had an awful look.
My fair Aurora, in a frank good way,
My falling-short that must be! work for two,
My fancies time to rise on wing,
My father had not changed for all the silk
My father pushed down on the bed for that,
My father taught me what he had learnt the best
My father was an austere Englishman,
My father, who through love had suddenly
My fathers face for theirs,and, though your world
My fathers sister started when she caught
My fathers slow hand, when she had left us both,
My fathers step on that deserted ground,
My fathers, or my mothers any more,
My fire-flies; made a knot as hard as life,
My flower of earth, my only flower on earth,
My foolish name too near upon the sea
My friend Lord Howe deputes his friend Sir Blaise,
My friend, the brother of my love;
My friends, you are all dismissed. Go, eat and drink
My German student,his own eyes full-blown
My great Aurora. Forward then she sprang,
My hair ... now could I but unloose my soul!
My hand off though twere kissed the hour before,
My hands a-tremble as I had just caught up
My hands struck sharp together, as hands do
My hatstrings tied for going, at the door
My heart beat in my brain. Lifes violent flood
My heart great with it. Then, at last, I spoke,
My heart leapt in me, startled by a voice
My heart to write with, in the place of it.
My hearts life throbbing in my verse to show
My humbleness, said One, has made me great!
My Italy of women, just to breathe
My kisses are all melted on one mouth;
My lady? ist to find my gentleman
My larks fly higher than some windows. Right;
My left hand washing in the Public Baths,
My letter would not be a night too late,
My life long sick with tossings up and down;
My lighter moods are like to these,
My long lease with him, when the time arrives
My look were fatal. Such a stream of folk,
My loose long hair began to burn and creep,
My lord, I cannot love. I only find
My love ... thats nature also;and at once,
My love, that might be! mine!
My loves not pity merely. Obviously
My Marian,always hard upon the rent
My meaning backward like your eastern books,
My men and women of disordered lives,
My Miriam, whose sweet mouth, when nearly drowned
My morning-dream was often hummed away
My morning-star, my morning! rise and shine,
My mother sold me to a man last month,
My mother took fright at the ugly world,
My mothers blood in me is not so strong
My mothers face. Though far too early, alas,
My mothers hater. From that day, she did
My multitudinous mountains, sitting in
My name is clean and open as this hand,
My name, my house, my hand, the things I could,
My nature, purpose, possible actions. What!
My old Assunta, too, was dead, was dead
My own best poets, am I one with you,
My own hills! Are you ware of me, my hills,
My own less bitter, rather more:
My own self-pity, like the red-breast bird,
My own soul hissing at me through the dark,
My part quite ended, all the footlights quenched,
My pen fell,
My Phœbus Apollo, soul within my soul,
My pipers,and if, sooth, you did not blow,
My poor Assunta, where she stood and moaned!
My prayers without the vicar; read my books,
My pretty, pretty blossom, an ill-wind
My purse upon the stones: when, as I had cast
My quickening inner life from those at watch.
My right hand teaching in the Ragged Schools,
My Romney!Lifting up my hand in his,
My Romney.
My saint, my soul! for surely youre my soul,
My scanty bundle up, and went my way,
My sister Marian, and be satisfied.
My sister Marian?can I hurt thee, dear?
My sister! let the night be neer so dark,
My soul agaze in my eyes. She could not say
My soul is not a pauper; I can live
My soul out once before you, ere I go,
My soul was singing at a work apart
My soul, if not my book, and argue well
My souls in haste to leap into the sun
My spirits onward,as some fallen balloon,
My steps out through the slow and difficult road.
My student murmured, rapt,‘Mark how she stirs!
My sudden step beside you: but for me,
My sweet, ray beauty! ... Up she snatched the child,
My teacher, who has taught me with a book,
My thought and aspiration, like the stops
My transatlantic girl, with golden eyes,
My truth and my religion, I depute
My Tuscan mother, who had fooled away
My vain phalanstery dissolved itself;
My veritable work. And as the soul
My voice, empaled upon rhymes golden hooks,
My wife would come, sir, or I had kept her back.
My wife, too? Heres my secret, I might keep
My will is bondsman to the dark;
My windows paid fort. I was shot at, once,
My woodland sister, sweet maid Marian,

no
No beast in this, but she may well go mad
No cab, no tuna nut on bacon.
No chaffinch, but implies the cherubim:
No character or glory in his times,
No cleaner maid than I was, took a step
No compliments, beseech you.
No danger of being wrecked upon a friend,
No data shown, but noticeable eyes
No devil lived on.
No evil in this marriage,rather good
No father, though I had one this side death,
No fly-blow gossip ever specked my life;
No harder word this evening, than ... goodnight;
No hint of death in all his frame,
No imputation on the lady there
No lapse of moons can canker Love,
No lemon, no melon!
No lily-muffled hum of a summer-bee,
No longer mine, nor like me; only there,
No Marian Erle indeed, but certainly
No Marian!Though I hinted what I knew,
No Marian; nowhere Marian. Almost, now,
No matter nowwell let it pass, you say.
No matterI bear on my broken tale.
No more ... except the child!... no more at all.
No more for earths familiar, household use,
No more indeed at all. I have not seen
No more of it, Aurora. Yesno more!
No more of women, spite of privilege,
No more than coins from Moscow circulate
No more than that, indeed.
No more than they do, when they sit and write
No more! That poor men narrowed their demands
No more! The best verse written by this hand,
No more; a need felt of anothers use
No motion! Without sensuous, spiritual
No name writ on itpoems, by the form;
No need of protestation in my words
No need to bring their damnable drugged cup,
No other being effective. Fear not, friend;
No other signalment but girl and child?
No party counts upon him, and all praise
No pebble at your foot, but proves a sphere;
No perfect artist is developed here
No perfect manners, without Christian souls:
No pet so tragic as a cigar to step on.
No potage in it able to exclude
No reasonable duty. While you sing
No rich nor poor, no gain nor loss nor stint,
No sadder thing than that, she swore, ‘to wrong
No shriek of soul in anguish could pierce through
No socialist within three crinolines,
No spiritual counterpart completed it
No sun could die, nor yet be born, unseen
No sweeper up of the chips, ... a girl I know,
No trace; not one carton.
No way to truth laborious, and no life,
No wise beautiful
No woman like me, counts him pitiable
No wonder if my eyes sent out some sparks.
No wonder that hes married, nor much more
No wonder,since Aurora failed him first!
No word was granted.Last, a letter came
No, twasnt Mrs. Brookes.‘Shes pretty?‘Who?
No, I met System Ion.
No, it can, as it is, it is a war. Raw as it is, it is an action.
No, it is open on one position.
No, it is opposed, art sees trade's opposition
No, it never propagates if I set a gap or prevention.
No, Lamia! shut the shutters, bar the doors
No, Mel Gibson is a casino's big lemon.
No, not for shame.
No, sir, prefer prison.
No, thats too simple! she would twist it thus,
no.

None else has reason to be proud of truth:
None says so to the man,and why indeed
None waits for me: I have my day to spend.

nor
Nor able to commend the kind of work
Nor any want-begotten rest.
Nor asked a question.
Nor Belmore, for the unity of aim
Nor branding summer suns avail
Nor brother, though I had twenty, much less you,
Nor can I creep and grope, as fits the dark,
Nor capable,I thought you knew as much,
Nor cease to love high, though I live thus low.
Nor chosen from a pretty pattern-book
Nor clean again from henceforth, you thank God?
Nor cloth hold, but I had it in my coat,
Nor could I weary, heart or limb,
Nor count our right hands stronger for being hoofs.
Nor dare to leave him friendless in the world
Nor drover of wild ponies out of Wales
Nor even a friend, that Lady Waldemar
Nor even of Romneythough hes worth us both.
Nor ever pause to ask how many ts,
Nor ever was, you know,but now am worse,
Nor ever. Do we love the schoolmaster,
Nor follow, tho' I walk in haste,
Nor Gods in wrath, ... but one that mixed with mine
Nor handle for a moment, as indeed
Nor handle,were too legal, who write young:
Nor he a father, since two mothers shall
Nor he nor I supposed the hurt so deep.
Nor leave more foot-marks than Apollos kine,
Nor let him see thee in the face too near
Nor love this woman, flinging her my soul
Nor mans nor womans. As I keep, myself,
Nor my aunt chide me. I lived on and on,
Nor myrtlewhich means chiefly love; and love
Nor outrun by our equipages:mine
Nor pinch my liberal soul, though I be poor,
Nor render decent you should toss a phrase
Nor signed she was unworthy, nor gave thanks,
Nor small, has said a poet of our day,
Nor so far saddened. If I am sad at all,
Nor start at every pebble or dead leaf,
Nor strike me dumb with thunder? Yet I speak:
Nor tempt you to an eyrie too high up,
Nor tire too much with following, out of breath,
Nor toward what place, nor to what end of all.
Nor use the generous leave of happiness
Nor use the sight ... except to drown himself:
Nor vex you when youre merry, nor when you rest:
Nor vex yourself with lamentable thoughts
Nor walk, nor take a book, nor lay it down,
Nor woman, but I led her by the hand,
Nor word of mine was needed. Some one else
Nor would I risk so much, in ease and calm,
Nor would you find within, a rosier flushed
Nor wound you, yet be worthy.
Nor yet the horse, before a quarry, a-graze:
Nor yet untender; so, enough. I felt
Nor you, Aurora,choose you shall repent
Nor, though the stars were suns, and overburned
Nor, what may count itself as blest,

not
Not a grand nature. Not my chestnut-woods
Not a word
Not a word he said.
Not as mere work, but as mere womans work,
Not bettered, quickened toward the truth and good
Not certainly the fairest of the year,
Not change thee!Thee I do not thank at all:
Not crampt in their foundations, pushing wide
Not dead,the womans duty, by so much,
Not despicable. Mountains of the south,
Not even my father, look from work or play
Not even this life I live, intolerable!
Not even to keep the colour at my lip.
Not even to say ‘God bless her? Thats our wrong;
Not far from being as steep as some larks climb,
Not God; she will not flinch for Him indeed:
Not good for much, and given to sulk and stare,
Not hope of sight,I could be learned, dear,
Not ill, and was not dull at needlework;
Not knowing wherefore she was ill at ease.
Not mans seduction, made me what I am,
Not miss his mothers lap, to sit with men.
Not much indeed, but something,took my hands,
Not much worse off in being fatherless
Not now, but on some other day or week:
Not once would writhe, nor quiver, nor revolt;
Not one day, in the artists ecstasy,
Not one found honestly deductible
Not one was rescued, save the Lady Maud,
Not overjoyous, truly. Women know
Not prouder than the swan is of the lake
Not Romney Leigh is mad enough to say,
Not sadder than is good for what I am.
Not scant in soulcomplete in lineaments;
Not seeing by what road, nor by what ship,
Not sew on steadily, nor drop a stitch
Not so,let drag your fiery fringes, heaven,
Not so.
Not so; Pygmalion loved,and whoso loves
Not troubling any in heaven, nor any on earth,
Not William Eries; not Marians fathers; tramp
Not worth the pains of his analysis
Not yet in reach of snapping. So I lived.
Not you! ... the dropping of the voice implied,
not.

Now he sets me down as vexed.
Now I see bees, I won.
Now let him see to it! for a rent within
Now obvious to me,for, most obviously,
Now press the clarion on thy womans lip
Now tell me ...
Now up, now down, now underfoot, and now
Now, do it; bring your statue,you have room!
Now, judge me! we have sate here half-an-hour
Now, may the good God pardon all good men!
Now, my maps.
Now, not even Romney.
Now, sometimes in my sorrow shut,
now.

O Art, my Art, thourt much, but Love is more!
O best Aurora! are you then so sad,
O calm, grand eyes, extinguished in a storm,
O dark, O moon and stars, O ecstasy
O father, wheresoe'er thou be,
O friend, well see it plainer: you and I
O heart,
O heart, how fares it with thee now,
O June-day friend, that help me now at night,
O jurists, rhymers, dreamers, what you please,
O land of all mens past! for me alone,
O life, O poetry,
O mother, praying God will save
O my forsaken heart, with thee
O my God, my God,
O Priestess in the vaults of Death,
O prophet in my heart, I cried aloud,
O Romney! O my angel! O unchanged,
O Romney, O Marian!
O Romney, O my Romney, O my friend!
O somewhere, meek, unconscious dove,
O Sorrow, cruel fellowship,
O supreme Artist, who as sole return
O sweet and bitter in a breath,
O what to her shall be the end?
O, not for thee the glow, the bloom,
o.

of
Of a dumb creature who had been beaten once,
Of a fiery finger through the uneven dark,
Of a generous breed,and will you let his act,
Of a man: and women, when they are made like you,
Of a mastodon, I nibbled here and there
Of a modest phrase,‘My gentle countrymen,
Of a noble gentleman like Romney Leigh,
Of a thunder-shower, he added, ‘The poor child;
Of abdicating power in it: she owned
Of all his individual, personal life,
Of all that nature. With a gradual step,
Of all that sheltering roof of circumstance
Of all the assembled castaways; such girls!
Of all the dogs, in reach of all the guns,
Of all the grand progression nought left out;
Of all the men and women in the world,
Of all things, hungry for the Infinite?
Of all those writers, wishing them alive
Of alternated colour, till at last
Of ampler draught.
Of any day or night; the moon and sun
Of any honest creature, howbeit weak,
Of arbutus and laurel. Out of sight
Of authors,not in earshot of the things
Of barley-feeding and material ease,
Of bats, that seem to follow in the air
Of being Grahams wife, until a friend observes,
Of being his true and honourable wife!
Of being in love ... in love! Thats coarse youll say.
Of being just hurt and honest; while for him,
Of being my Shakspeares.
Of Bellosguardo. Tis a tower that keeps
Of blank obstruction, and a roar i the ears
Of blood and brain swept outward upon words,
Of bubbled rose, to make his mother laugh;
Of calling the French light. The levity
Of catching from the fringes of the wind
Of choral vestures,troubled in his blood,
Of coffin sawdust, set the chairs anew
Of colder reasons, and she shall not lose
Of course a womanswhile I dreamed a tale
Of course I know that, lonely among my vines,
Of course the people came in uncompelled,
Of course throw monstrous shadows: those who think
Of course!I mean no harm in wishing well.
Of course, she found that in me, she saw that,
Of cousins, therefore, with the rest. For me,
Of crisis and transition in this life,
Of crystal conscience he was born into
Of curds. We want more quiet in our works,
Of darkness! O great mystery of love,
Of dealing with statistically packed
Of death, had got theirs ready. And she said,
Of dedication to the human need,
Of deepening, widening a large lap of life
Of delicate features,paler, near as grave;
Of desperate creatures calling for the Dead.
Of devils gifts ... hunts liberally in packs,
Of difference in the qualityand still
Of difficult questions; yet, obtuse to me,
Of disputable virtue say not, sin
Of doing something. Many tender souls
Of doves between the temple-columns. Dear,
Of English ss, soft as a silent hush,
Of equal love, keep saying, ‘So we think,
Of even a sheep-path, thinking bitterly....
Of faces, rose upon you everywhere,
Of fair fantastic Paris who wears boughs
Of finer meditation.
Of folded innocences, self-complete,
Of forms less, and the external. Trust the spirit,
Of full-breathed beauty. If the heart within
Of garlicwhich, whatever else you eat,
Of giving judgment on the parts of speech,
Of Gods skirt, with a dazzle to ghosts and men,
Of golden glory, and the mountains steeped
Of golden patterns: not a stone of wall
Of graves. I would not visit, if I could,
Of headless bodies, shapeless, indistinct!
Of Heavens high blue, and, nestling down, peer out
Of heavy tumbling motions, creaking wheels,
Of her beautiful June-youth. But here again
Of her garments ... falling off.
Of Him who reads for judgement. Innocent,
Of his dead love. So be it. I preserve
Of His inner nature,the spontaneous love
Of his sex merely. You forget too much
Of holy art and golden life. I am young,
Of hospitals, almshouses, infant schools,
Of how a fairy bride from Italy,
Of illness,not the issue ... not the extent:
Of incomethat were justice; but, alas,
Of individual life, I poured myself
Of indurated veins, distorted joints,
Of innocence, to pastoralise in song:
Of intense sea betwixt them and the ship,
Of King Sauls fathers asses, in full drove,
Of knitting stockings, stitching petticoats,
Of knowledge into social nurseries
Of Lady Waldemar, as spoken out
Of liberal education,tongues, not books.
Of lies, by being constrained to lie on still;
Of life, and then fell backward on repose.
Of lifes experience.
Of light beyond him. Arts a service,mark:
Of lilies, or a heart marked Emily,
Of losing for your sake so poor a prize
Of luminous faces, for a cup-bearer,
Of lying quiet there where I was thrown
Of Marians feet between the incessant surfs
Of martyrised society,on the left,
Of me, incurious! likes me very well,
Of mens opinions ... press and counterpress,
Of minnow gods, nymphs here, and tritons there;
Of mismade human nature. Grant the man
Of morals, dropping round me. Lively books?
Of most celestial innocence! For me
Of mother nature more than others use,
Of my fathers books; although the Elzevirs
Of my fathers silence, to shriek back a word,
Of my last subscription. Is it bearable,
Of my long poem, if twere sold outright,
Of mystic contemplations, come to feed
Of naked iron, mad with merriment,
Of nestled birdlings; everything so soft
Of nightingales all singing in the dark,
Of now a spotted Hydra-skin cast off,
Of obstinate purpose, still those words of yours,
Of olive-trees, with interruptions green
Of one a full day dead. I hold it true,
Of one day seeing heaven too. The police
Of one we have helped! Thanks, Marian, for that help.
Of one we know, ... to acknowledge, palm to palm,
Of open foreign country, large and strange,
Of Oviedo, the internal laws
Of pain and passion, she wrung loose my hands
Of parish news, like doctors to the sick,
Of passionate indignation, I who had risen
Of perished summers, like a rose in a book,
Of personal dues with that sweet eglantine
Of philanthropical self-sacrifice,
Of phrase and metaphrase. Why, any man
Of pipe or flute, are absolutely dumb
Of poets are fresher than the worlds highways;
Of presence and affection, excellent
Of putting down the womans,I forgot
Of ribbon on the boulevard, worth a sou?
Of rigid poplars elbowed it behind,
Of Romneys marriage to a certain saint;
Of roses that had never been in bud.
Of rough, uneasy wilderness, poor lamb,
Of savage spontaneity, that stir
Of sexual passion, which devours the flesh
Of shaking dangerous questions from the crease,
Of simulated stature, face, and speech,
Of social classes, had received one seal,
Of social figments, feints, and formalisms,
Of social justice and equality
Of social questions, can approve, applaud
Of soft, serene defiance,as she knew
Of some abolished temple, helplessly
Of some domestic idealogue, who sits
Of some habitual thoughts. Henceforth, my flower,
Of some sublime inherited despair,
Of something as it chanced seven years ago,
Of sons and daughters, when they fall in love,
Of sorrow your rich love sits down to pay:
Of speaking angerly to any child,
Of startled horses plunged into the mist
Of stature over-tall, lounging for ease;
Of staying to be married? a fine tale!
Of still expanding and ascending gyres,
Of stretching past the known and seen, to reach
Of such a marriage ... where you do not love,
Of such a mystic substance, Sharon gave
Of such a woman, with low timorous lids
Of such fair acres,in the parish, too!
Of such high-stumbling natures, murmured words,
Of such irregular work, he drank and slept,
Of such large natures, ever competent
Of such weak flutterings? Why, we like it, sir,
Of sure solution. ‘Loves me! he loves all,
Of surface-picturespretty, cold, and false
Of tender turf, and wore and lost itself
Of that fine music,which, being carried in
Of that intolerable glory, ran
Of that Phalarian bull, society,
Of that poor bubbling nature,till she went,
Of that said mother, disinherited
Of that theurgic nature? I must fail,
Of the Burmese empire, ... by how many feet
Of the burthen of it, than King Solomon
Of the editorial ‘we in a review,
Of the eldest, who has learnt to drop her lids
Of the English-fashioned shroud, the last brocade
Of the first Napoleons dry bones, as they lay
Of the G. Now listen,let us understand;
Of the garden, dropped the mystic floating grey
Of the house-windows, he abruptly caught
Of the infant body on the uncertain feet,
Of the inmost, most interior of the interne,
Of the inner life, with all its ample room
Of the less scrutable majesties. For me,
Of the letter with its twenty stinging snakes,
Of the lovely tumbled curls about his face;
Of the lowland burrs with which you scatter them.
Of the mathematics,brushed with extreme flounce
Of the old Greeksconferenda hæc cum his
Of the only truth-tellers, now left to God,
Of the opening social era. But take heed;
Of the Poggio called and counted every pulse
Of the skyey palpitation. Gradually
Of the social hedge,
Of the soil, ... but of the sweat in tilling it,
Of the spiritual,we feel ourselves shut in
Of the sweep of his white raiment. Touch and hold!
Of the under-waistcoat. With an absent air
Of the universal, and send clearly up
Of the unschooled speaker: I have rather writ
Of the wind, will toss about her flower-apples.
Of their dead selves to higher things.
Of things terrestrial,letters and the rest;
Of this dead weight! best, perfectly be stunned
Of this live flood. She may have moved this way,
Of this poor, passionate, helpless blood
Of this sealed letter by a puff of fate,
Of this steep question, and may rest, I think.
Of this, dear cousin.
Of those loose, soft, impracticable curls,
Of those they cannot bear yet to call dead,
Of those who love not! tis so lost to me,
Of thought and golden image. He can stand
Of tortured prisoners in the polished brass
Of tragic masks, we tie before the glass,
Of trailing garments, shall not trip me up.
Of tresses ... there, a man stood, with beasts eyes,
Of tresses, then be careful lest the rich
Of troubling passion in him, burned him clear,
Of trying to do good without the church
Of turning on my pillow and harder thoughts,
Of tying sashes, fitting baby-shoes,
Of universal anguish?Show me a tear
Of universal hideous want and wrong
Of ups and downs. My hand shakes, I am blind,
Of Vallombrosa, cleaving by the spurs
Of various life caught back upon His arm,
Of verdure, field from field, as man from man;
Of verdure,nothing too much up or down,
Of virtue, chiefly used to sit and darn,
Of virtuous Romney and his high-born race,
Of visionary chariots which retreat
Of voice he interrupted‘what names that?
Of vowels in their pleasant scandalous talk
Of waters, that cry out for joy or fear
Of wealthy ease and honourable toil,
Of what befits ...
Of what his hand materially has made,
Of what is, and I, haply, overbold
Of what she has suffered by you, and what debt
Of what they are not. Most illogical
Of what they know not. Romneys strong enough
Of what was signified by taking soup
Of what we think or are; albeit our thoughts
Of which none names the moment that it goes,
Of which the said testatrix dies possessed.
Of who sate open-eyed behind her. There,
Of whom you will not ever feel ashamed?
Of wicked women and penitentiaries,
Of widower and father, nursing me,
Of womans mission, womans function, till
Of work like this!... perhaps a womans soul
Of writing many books there is no end;
Of yearning passion, as snow of ghosts
Of yore, dear, how you used to cheat old John,
Of you and of my cousin. May you be
Of you, Aurora, any more than me
Of young vivacious and black-braided heads
Of younger life on my side, and on his,

on
On a beggars middle finger, and require
On a clover, if alive, erupts a vast pure evil; a fire volcano.
On a single trine of brazen tortoises,
On all his missions and commissions, schools,
On all my birthdays for me, save the last;
On all my tables, with a place for Sue;
On any peasants face here, coarse and lined,
On Argive heights divinely sang,
On arts side.
On both sides!
On changing England for Australia
On cherry-blossoms, brightened Marian too,
On commons, picking hops, or hurrying on
On days too cold for raining any more,
On dead mens bones, and cannot turn up soil
On English ground
On evenings, watching how they fined themselves
On every leaf of this,unless the drops
On evil days, you poets, if yourselves
On happy mornings, with a morning heart,
On hearing lovely music, suddenly
On his side probably; men always have,
On Joseph Strangways, the Leeds mesmerist,
On keeping, though the dead was out of sight,
On Lady Waldemar. ‘Miss Leigh, she said,
On life and art, and whether, after all,
On lurid morns or monstrous afternoons,
On man or act, my cousin. We have read
On marble floors, I will not augur him
On meditative spoonfuls of vanille,
On Memphis-road, have chanced, perhaps, to set
On morning visits, feeling a joint wrong,
On personal virtue. If he understands
On pickpockets at suck.
On Raffaels mild Madonna of the Bird.
On red curls.Lucy Gresham swooned last night,
On Romneys feet, we heard the kisses drawn
On shining paper. But theyre hard sometimes,
On socialistic troublers of close bonds
On some light pretext. She would turn her head
On stifled brains and deafened ears, stunned deaf,
On such a day the marriage at the church.
On such a happy summer-afternoon
On such a night, at close of many years,
On such and such a season; sate and sewed,
On such June mornings.
On summer-nights, when God is sad in heaven
On that abrupt black line of cypresses
On that June-day, Aurora. Poor bright day,
On that same day, was Marians work complete:
On the Appian road, for morals?
On the bald street breaks the blank day.
On the head of the foundering universe,what then?
On the other side the leaf! ignore her so,
On their side. Not that any of these would say
On this dismembering of society,
On this same tragic stage on which we have failed,
On three successive Sundays; ay, and stopped
On tip-toe like escaping murderers,
On utterance. Only, ... in this world we have made,
On what you should do, or you should not do,
On which his well-known hand had left a word.
On which one tries unlike similitudes
On which the lads were busy with their staves
On which the pearls, drowned out of sight in milk,
On which we are feeding. Ay, materialist
On winter nights by solitary fires,
On zoologic soirées? Not in the least.

Once blew upon my breast! can any think
Once jilted by a recreant pretty maid

One artist-dream, on straw or down, my lord,
One day ... how full the memories come up!
One day, said Marian,the sun shone that day
One day, the last before the dreaded last,
One eve it happened, when I sate alone,
One fills their cup at supper with pure wine,
One footstep for the noblest lover born.
One gaze, she stood! then, slowly as he smiled,
One man,and he my cousin, and he my friend,
One moonbeam from the forehead to the crown!
One morning on Olympus, with a step
One steadying finger of it, and desert
One straining past another along the shore,
One thing alone was certain,from the day
One writes, that `Other friends remain,'
One, forward, personal, wanting reverence,
one.
Ones apt to use strong phrases, being in love
Ones ugly fretting! he has eyes the same

Or `here to-morrow will he come.'
Or active outline on the indifferent air!
Or all the life in heaven seems slow and cold:
Or answers ‘dark at random,while, be sure,
Or as a babe sucks surely in the dark.
Or as she blew the down-balls of her dreams,
Or as the fiery sap, the touch from God,
Or Baldinacci, when her F in alt
Or be ourselves unworthy; here we are wronged,
Or beautiful new cases of curved spine;
Or book, which is a man too.
Or bosoms white as foam thrown up on rocks
Or breaking into song by fits,
Or but my sleeve? I trembled, hand and foot,
Or cast a lambs small shadow on the lawn,
Or choosing mackerel. Neighbours, who dropped in
Or cloth she only seem to take
Or compound fractions. Therefore, this same world
Or cross him when hes eager. Understand
Or crush her, like a vice of blood,
Or did his arms constrain me? Were my cheeks
Or did I worship? judge, Aurora Leigh!
Or did not send it, but the foolish John
Or did she put a word into her face
Or down to death. She knew, by such an act,
Or drags him up the hills to find me flowers
Or dropt and swooned; or, like a herd of deer,
Or else ... ‘You bite your lip in such a way,
Or else a pictured ceiling overhead,
Or else a sheaf of leaves for that small Ruths
Or else at best, a cushion, where you lean
Or else he had not made it. If a man
Or else I sate on in my chamber green,
Or else it falls on us and grinds us flat,
Or else my purple lilies, Dante blew
Or else the authorbooks demonstrating
Or else their rest in quiet crypts,laid by
Or else they better had been choked with air
Or else they had flown not, where they agonise,
Or else too little, for immortal man;
Or else, of old, I had not looked so near
Or ere the giant image broke on them,
Or ere you pour our wine. For arts sake, pause.
Or even die, like any decent wretch
Or even excuse myself to honest souls
Or even in the catacombs, ... his torch
Or even straighter and more consequent
Or even the squires, Aurora. Do you mind
Or even with something less. You stand outside,
Or ever I sucked milk, and so is lost.
Or ever they make issue past themselves
Or ever we let go. For everywhere
Or fear of evil, all that could be mine,
Or grow anew familiar with the sun,
Or half a play of Shakspeares, torn across:
Or has the shock, so harshly given,
Or heres another on the self-same theme.
Or hows the headache which you had last week,
Or I hear wildly. In that morning-time
Or if beneath our feet, we did not know.
Or if he loved her, being so much beloved:
Or is it that the Devil slavers them
Or keep their children back from catechism,
Or kill'd in falling from his horse.
Or last year, rather than a thing we saw,
Or leave it in the foldings of her gown,
Or leave us to the grief we grow ourselves
Or less good,even as all society,
Or like to noiseless phantoms flit;
Or longer. ‘Sleep, I thought, ‘late sleepers,sleep,
Or loses half its virtue. Make it tell,
Or lost a love, or missed a world, perhaps?
Or lovely poet-words grown obsolete,
Or make small way. I apprehended this,
Or many a little lighted village, dropt
Or me,for London or for Edinburgh;
Or men or womenmores the pity.
Or Mister Others marriage, or decease,
Or my dead mother, without smile or kiss,
Or no child,if a child, then one to save!
Or on to where the pathway leads;
Or one of those tall flowering reeds which stand
Or one of us speaks vainlythats not I.
Or peradventure niggardly half-truths;
Or peradventure Satans usual trick
Or perfumed gloves for headaches,though aware
Or perhaps, again,
Or piteous foundlings; might unquestioned set
Or pluck your gown, and humbly mind you so
Or rarer tokens from young bachelors,
Or rather, might have given, observe!for thats
Or reach a hand thro' time to catch
Or roses, sleeping past the hour of noon
Or safe, that I can help you. That June-day,
Or say, the child should hold her round the neck
Or see (in Him is no before)
Or seemed,and generous souls cried out, ‘Be strong,
Or should be, if grown foreign to myself
Or so I took it,‘for St. Lucys sake,
Or so? For days, her touching, foolish lines
Or some glass pin,they have their weight with girls.
Or sorrow such a changeling be?
Or sorrows petrifying to vices: not
Or squirrel against the oak-gloom flashing up
Or such a silence, that he thought sometimes,
Or talked too much, or felt the wind i the east,
Or thank him.Tis Lord Howe.
Or that the past will always win
Or think thats worse, ‘Theres some one in the house
Or this or that,but, once beings wholly waked,
Or took it for a cloud; but, otherwise
Or touch your hands as lovers do? thank God
Or touched a lottery with her finger-end,
Or unsigned, showing the writers at eighteen
Or vain all thoughts of his to help the world,
Or wash out my own blots, in counting yours,
Or ways: it made me blush to look at her;
Or what is called so,when a woman frets
Or what you think of Mister Some-ones book,
Or what, perhaps, shall simply trouble him,
Or where the kneeling hamlet drains
Or wheres the resurrection?
Or why you look so pale still, since its gone?
Or wish ... O love, I have loved you! O my soul,
Or womanswhich is greatest? most averse
Or worse, well say. For dogs, unjustly kicked,
Or would he pine on such, or haply starve?
Or write not: we want string to tie our flowers,
Or, dying, there at least may die.
Or, failing so much, fill up, bridge at least
Or, if I fail, still, purely for myself.
Or, if it did not, all the bridal noise ...
Or, if you are tender, heave a sigh and go,
Or, my own mother, leaving her last smile
Or, peradventure, traps? What drew me back
or.

Our Apis-public lowing. Oh, he wants,
Our aspiration, who bespoke our place
Our base needs, keeping down our lofty thoughts,
Our book and cry, ... ‘Ah you, you care for rhymes;
Our cholera catch you with its cramps and spasms,
Our cup of water is not tendered till
Our evils in statistics, are inclined
Our fathers chose,and therefore, when they had hung
Our fathers made so fine with rushes once,
Our fathers,plagued enough about our sons!
Our five pyramidal acts with one act more,
Our heart drives blood! theres not a flower of spring,
Our home-bred fancies. O to us,
Our Lady for her gossip, and frets on
Our Lady of the Passion, stabbed with swords
Our little systems have their day;
Our love, to pay our debts with?
Our Lucy Gresham. I expected it
Our Lucys thread went faster than her breath,
Our meat and drink grow painful prophecy:
Our natural world too insularly, as if
Our physics, a completer poetry
Our poems to find rhymes among the stars!
Our proud ancestral Leighs with those peaked beards,
Our tip-toe aspirations, touch a thing
Our very heart of passionate womanhood,
Our virtues, cousin, from our worn-out sins,
Our ways as well as walk them, and no friend
Our wills are ours, to make them thine.
Our wills are ours, we know not how;
Our work shall still be better for our love,

perhaps
Perhaps a better woman after all,
Perhaps a real Marian.
Perhaps by what youre mulcted in, your hearts
Perhaps I am not worthy, as you say,
Perhaps I darkened, as the light-house will
Perhaps I doubt more than you doubted then,
Perhaps I looked as white as any ghost
Perhaps its natural, though the phrase is strong;
Perhaps she had to do with a marine
Perhaps she played at commerce with a ship
Perhaps we had lived too closely, to diverge
Perhaps we name it Natures voice, or Loves,
Perhaps you thought the marriage suitable,
Perhaps, if I had found a literal Muse,
Perhaps, O friend, I set you up so high
Perhaps, to make them sound half rational

Scarce keep them in the cupboard, next the prunes.
Scarce knowing which way she was praised the most.
Scarce known from evenings! also, let me say,
Scarce lacked that thunderbolt of the falling beam,
Scarce larger than a grave, and near as bare;
Scarce need be poets. Keep to the green wreath,
Scarce safer for his place there. He, at least,
Scarce worth the price of sackcloth, week by week,

she
She added quickly, ‘I repeat his words,
She always has been looking round the earth
She bade me never tell him that she had come,
She bounded off and ‘lighted beyond reach,
She came to see me nine times, rather ten
She comes now.
She could not bear the joy of giving life
She could not buy more drink. At which she turned,
She could not leave a solitary soul
She could not take the trouble to be cross,
She damps her babys cheeks by kissing them,
She did not for the Marchioness of Perth,
She dressed in at the Pitti. ‘He should paint
She dropt her head,
She ever used in life, was used for hate,
She feared to startle in touching. ‘You are kind.
She felt her name hiss after her from the hills,
She felt so pretty and so pleased all day
She felt within his utterance and his eyes
She filched it somewhere; and it means, with her,
She flew contrarious in the face of God
She fluttered from me like a cyclamen,
She found me a servants place in Paris where
She had dropped, she had fainted.
She had lived, well say,
She had never heard of angels,but to gaze
She had not thought about his love at all:
She had smoothed the empty bed, and swept the floor
She had the low voice of your English dames,
She had to guess the bottom of a page
She hales perdition on him. ‘So, being mad,
She half forgets, at moments, to be proud
She has your books by heart, more than my words,
She heard the quick pants of the hills behind,
She hurried upward, shot across a face,
She hurt me, hurt, as if the morning-sun
She is no mother, but a kidnapper,
She is not used to hold my gown so fast,
She kept her bosom holy to her babes;
She kissed me mouth to mouth: I felt her soul
She knew not why, to see she knew not what,
She knew of Right, the more she guessed their wrong;
She knit her restless forehead. ‘Then, despite,
She knows my turns, my feeble points.What then?
She lay and seethed in fever many weeks,
She leaned above him drinking him as wine
She learnt God that way, and was beat for it
She leaves me,she departs,she disappears,
She left him, not to hurt him; or perhaps
She let me go,while I, with ears too full
She lies hereflat upon her prison-floor,
She liked a woman to be womanly,
She liked my fathers child to speak his tongue.
She liked to love me better than he knew,
She listens on, exactly as if he talked
She looked me in the face and answered not,
She looked the whiter for her smile.
She loved him so perhaps, such words mean love,
She loved indeed,Rose Bell, a seven years child,
She loved me wholly.
She loved one in her class,or did not love,
She loves you like her diamonds ... almost.
She loves you, sir, with passion, to lunacy;
She may not do it with such unworthy love
She meant a commination, or, at best,
She might ... although hes better than her best,
She might be sicker yet, if sickness made
She might have gone on talking half-an-hour,
She misliked women who are frivolous.
She neither sews nor spins,and takes no thought
She never answered that, but shook her head;
She never raised her eyes, nor took a step,
She only knew so much she had chronicled,
She owned, ‘Twas plain a man like Romney Leigh
She paused.
She plunged her fingers in his clustering locks,
She promised kindly to provide the means,
She put away your love two years ago,
She puts off her patched petticoat to-day
She resumed.
She said at last. ‘I will not, I replied;
She said her name quite simply, as if it meant
She said she could be like you only so,
She said sometimes, ‘Aurora, have you done
She said, ‘I like to be sincere at once;
She said, but, in a gentle humbled way,
She said, in speaking of it, ‘If a flower
She said; ‘farewell then. Write your books in peace,
She sate ... it sate ... we said ‘she yesterday ...
She saw her stop to speak in Oxford Street
She scarcely marvelled to see Romney Leigh.
She seemed to me an innocent, frank girl
She seized my hands with both hers, strained them fast,
She served me after all it was not strange;
She sewed and sewed and sewed. She drooped sometimes,
She shall have surely, liberally, for her
She shook her head.
She should not ask me where I meant to sleep;
She slowly swung
She smiled beyond the sun, and ended so,
She smiled too, slowly, smiling unaware,
She spent a fortnights meals on, yesterday,
She stirred;the place seemed new and strange as death.
She stood a moment silent in her place;
She stood as if I held her. ‘For his sake,
She stood there, still and pallid as a saint,
She stood upon the steps to welcome me,
She struck the new thread into her needles eye,
She struggled for her ordinary calm,
She takes a riband or a rose;
She thought to find my mother in my face,
She told me how he had raised and rescued her
She told me she had loved upon her knees,
She told me she was almost glad and calm
She told me tenderly, as when men come
She told me truths I asked for ... twas my fault ...
She told me, ‘exactly as he uttered them
She told the tale with simple, rustic turns,
She took it, as you do at sacrament,
She touched me with her face and with her voice,
She trusted once, through what flagitious means
She turns and says, ‘I will not tax you so,
She understood: she had supposed, indeed,
She was born for. Women of a softer mood,
She was gone.
She was not born to. Had they kept the north,
She was there in sight
She went on:
She whispered once the children side by side,
She will not say it now more wonderingly;
She will not surely blame him. As for me,
She would have turned to leave me, but I clung.
She wrapt me in her generous arms at once,
She, at that,
She, Marian, did not tell it so, but used
She, Marian, saw things different,felt distrust
She, moveless as a worm beneath a stone
Shed budge, twas obvious, for such worthless odds:
Shed grant me nothing: Ive compounded for
Shed win a tern in Thursdays lottery,
Shell hear the softest hum of Hyblan bee
Shell make a perfect wife for Carrington.
Shell not be thwarted by an obstacle
Shes changed since then!and once, for social ends,
Shes gracious to me as her husbands friend,
Shes Lady Waldemarto the left,in red
Shes pure in aim, I grant you,like myself,
Shes talked of, too, at least as certainly,
Shes there now, in the little room, asleep,
Shes very pretty, Lady Waldemar.

should
Should any to the poem? A ninth seal;
Should bring despair of Gods too. Yet be taught;
Should grow up from the sullen second floor
Should gulf him fathom-deep in brine;
Should litter in the Dramas throne-room, where
Should make ado for such as she.‘Defiled
Should make confessions....
Should nod a shadow upon his victor face.
Should oar me across the sparkling brawling stream
Should see thy passengers in rank
Should smite us on the eyelids when we sleep,
Should strike a sudden hand in mine,
Should that be y or ithey knowt so well:
Should toss with tangle and with shells.

since
Since day by day he came, and, every day,
Since even dreaming of the stone and bronze
Since ever to be seen by only one,
Since first taught spelling by its grandmother,
Since God collected and resumed in man
Since God himself is for you, and a child!
Since I was too ambitious in my deed,
Since last we met and parted, youre unchanged,
Since love, she knows, is justified of love.
Since none but you has Mister Leighs own blood
Since none seems worthy of my thought and hope
Since our first Sun arose and set.
Since thats the womans special, proper ache,
Since then,but still that day will catch my breath
Since this is now-a-days turned privilege,
Since virtue kindles at the touch of joy,
Since when was genius found respectable?
Since when, she lives, remembers, palpitates
Since yesterday at this timeyet, again,
Since, ... drop your hand in mine a moment, sweet,

so
So absolute in dogma, proud in aim,
So absolutely: leave two clocks, they say,
So be it then. But how this serves your ends,
So beautiful, she hurts me like the day
So bold for conscience, quick for martyrdom,
So bold to cross the Alp by Lombardy
So bring him; we have idle dreams:
So called, I can remember a friends words
So certainly, hell fall into the pit
So close upon me, that I felt the sigh
So close, my very garments crept and thrilled
So deep; and fifty churches answer it
So deeply, that they quiver to their tops
So doubtful if to thaw itself away
So draw him home to those that mourn
So drop them as we walk, which serves to show
So dull, so blind, and only half alive,
So early in the race, or throw my flowers,
So early o mornings. This verbena strains
So equally dividing the long hair,
So excellently, that we come to doubt
So faint with winter while so quick with spring,
So fair a face even,he must quickly lose
So far below to find them: let me think
So far in the east. The occidental flats
So find I every pleasant spot
So generous to me. Farewell, friend, since friend
So gentle, because verily so proud;
So gently, like the light upon a hill,
So glad, I could not choose be very wise!
So happy half with her and half with heaven
So happy with her, Romney, that your friends
So heavily overladen. And, since help
So here be rhymes to pore on under trees,
So high above, you could not see below;
So high and cold to others and yourself,
So high into the bowery almond-trees,
So high lived Romneys bride. I paused at last
So high up, I should shine because of height
So high, it topples down to the other side,
So ill, observe, that therefore hes cashiered.
So innocent, male-fiends might slink within
So it clears,
So it is:
So it was.
So joyless, she was thankless even to God,
So just a man and gentle, could not choose
So kind an office hath been done,
So life, in deepening with me, deepened all
So light, it catches at the knightly spurs
So like a Leigh! so like him!Pardon me,
So long upon my acres, undisturbed,
So long! before the sun and moon were made,
So many dynamos.
So many seasons I had forgot my Springs;
So many Tuscan evenings passed the same!
So Marian sate by Lucys bed, content
So may whatever tempest mars
So mere a woman!and I love you so,
So mothers have Gods licence to be missed.
So much best to us, that what personates love
So much for the connivances of fear,
So much for the necessities of power,
So much for vice, so much for discontent,
So much he has to teach! so good a world!
So much love since, I pray you pardon me,
So much more than of sisters; otherwise,
So much the vital spirits sink
So near the image of the unfavouring Muse?
So obstinately, that well break our teeth
So oft outreach themselves with jets of fire
So old, so new! It would be dreadful now
So old, to kneel grew easier than to stand,
So open all the letters! let me read.
So pale and patient, like the marble man
So piled with feudal relics. You admire
So plainly in tune to these things and the rest,
So pray dont speak to me, Lord Belcher.‘No,
So pretty and clever, who read syllables
So quickly, waiting for a hand,
So safe in impuissance and despair,
So said your cousin, while we stood and felt
So save you! for the world ... and Carrington.
So seems it in my deep regret,
So shook me? That, I know not. There were words
So silent, that you heard a young bird fall
So soft and soundless, simply beautiful,
So solitary, she accepts at last
So speaking, with less anger in my voice
So sternly undivertible of aim,
So straight call out on genius, say, ‘A man
So strange and gay and ignorant of my face,
So strangely similar to the tortoise-shell
So sucked her forward, forward, while her heart
So surely is your whiteness to be found
So sympathetic to the personal pang,
So trifling as ... her soul is, ... much less yours!
So very gladly, as a part of his,
So very kind was Lady Waldemar:
So wary and afeared of hurting you,
So we passed
So weary and sad to-night, Im somewhat sour,
So wholly godlike.
So wisely, and of you, so tenderly,
So wrong, so proud, so weak, so unconsoled,
So,
So, good!The mans need of the woman, here,
So, happy and unafraid of solitude,
So, hard for women to keep pace with men!
So, nine full years, our days were hid with God
So, please you, be fanatical in love,
So, righting His creations balance-scale
So, she bent
So, wandering, musing, with the artists eye,
so.

some
Some ‘Id be a butterfly, or ‘Cest lamour:
Some bad things excellently. Both were praised,
Some beauteous dame, half chattel and half queen,
Some call the ideal,better called the real,
Some central pivot of their thought and choice,
Some city friend would lead her by the hand
Some coin of price!... and when a good man comes
Some compensation, some sufficiency
Some cranny of unfathomable time,
Some dolorous message knit below
Some English question ... whether men should pay
Some equal poise of sex, some unvowed love
Some fair, fine trace of what was written once,
Some flying on still, like scatterings of dead leaves
Some fragmentary phrases, here and there,
Some freedom of the many, that respects
Some gaslights tremble along squares and streets;
Some grand circumference of a shadowy dome
Some Greek upon the margin,ladys Greek,
Some learned member of the Institute
Some men interpret nine memos.
Some old Rhine tower or principality?
Some over-delicate nostrils, like your own,
Some pale for fear, a few as red for hate,
Some passion in it, furrowing up the flats,
Some people always sigh in thanking God
Some people make no trouble when they die.
Some pleasure from thine early years.
Some reconciling perfume.
Some red colossal cow, with mighty paps
Some Scandinavian myth of Lemures,
Some simply curious, some just insolent,
Some stale ancestral debt was after-paid
Some stray odd volume from his heavy pack,
Some sweet saints blood must quicken in our palms,
Some tears fell down my cheeks, and then I smiled,
Some two hours after, folded in a sheet
Some unaware unbuttoned casualty
Some upstroke of an alpha and omega
Some wealth, that leaves none poor and finds none tired,
Some words as truthful as the thing of mine

still
Still apprehended, consciously or not,
Still blind, he called them to the use of sight,
Still bound, wherever else, to another land;
Still brought me nearer to the central truth.
Still carrying the necessary shops,
Still cleaving to me, like the sucking asp
Still crumbling through your fingers to your feet
Still did most mischief where she meant most love.
Still drop by drop adown the finger of God,
Still dropt and lifted toward the mulberry-tree
Still farther from your voice, until they came
Still farther than we read. I know your heart,
Still good enough to pray in. And, being chaste
Still grind your paltry wants and low desires
Still growing like the plants from unseen roots
Still high to me. I mean no compliment:
still I have heard thee crying through my life,
Still insolently at Gods adverb snatch,
Still keep its splendor, and remain pure art?
Still leaving out the essential prophets word
Still less Gods glory as we sew ourselves
Still less. And thus she took for granted first,
Still liable, if once he looked that way,
Still onward winds the dreary way;
Still organised by, and implying life.
Still pointed that way. That way, went my thoughts
Still proof and outflow of spontaneous life?
Still restless with the last nights dancing int,
Still warm and thrilling from the clasp of one ...
Still wish some happier fortune to your friend,
Still worse than orphaned: tis too heavy a grief,
Still worthy of having spoken out the truth,
Still, Lifes voice!still, we make our peace with Life.

such
Such clouds of nameless trouble cross
Such delicate perspectives of full life;
Such devils would pull angels out of heaven,
Such eyes! I could not paint or think of eyes
Such good do mothers. Fathers love as well
Such have not settled long and deep enough
Such leaners on my shoulder? poor to think,
Such leaves! what leaves?
Such most surprising riddance of ones life
Such mothers let us play and lose our time,
Such nooks of valleys, lined with orchises,
Such obdurate jaws were thrown up constantly,
Such precious relics brought by thee;
Such quick forgetting on the part of men!
Such scholar-scraps he talked, Ive heard from friends,
Such skies!all clouds abolished in a sweep
Such sounding brass has done some actual good,
Such sudden madness seizing a young man,
Such utterance from such faces: poor blind souls
Such women, competent to ... spell.
Such work I have for doing, elbow-deep

Than a sublime art frivolously.
Than all I have failed in. But I failed besides
Than any failure.
Than any hitherto beheld for clouds!
Than any of their prosperities? what then,
Than any of your œconomists:for which,
Than any sheep-dog trained imperfectly,
Than Art can pile the faggots.
Than as an actual grace it can at all.
Than as your wife I could be!O, my star,
Than build a system:yet thats easy, too,
Than crush her silly head with so much wrong.
Than even for harder service. So I read
Than even my fathers. Romney now was turned
Than even the Sunday-school did afterward,
Than even to have made us! thou, aspire, aspire
Than even to have written a far better book.
Than ever I find reasons for. Alas,
Than God and mothers: even you would think
Than Gods truth! better, for companions sweet,
Than great convictions! let us bear our weights,
Than haply a mans footstep, has gone wrong.
Than has your loathing, though the last appears
Than I did. Certain of your feebler souls
Than I shall, how you tricked poor Marian Erle,
Than I was, fathered. He will say, belike,
Than I with crying. Oh, alone, alone,
Than if he loved ill what deserves love well.
Than if they praised him?Weep, my Æschylus,
Than if with thee the roaring wells
Than if you dressed him in a broad-cloth coat
Than in all England. Since that threw me off
Than just love. Self-forgot, cast out of self,
Than lie in a great queens bosom.
Than lies there to be seen. So much for pride;
Than make my dinner on his beef and beer.
Than many a hand that reaped a harvest in
Than many a happier woman. Very proud
Than men in benediction. God says, ‘Sweat
Than mine, my best,who laughed so loud to-night
Than never to have loved at all.
Than now I stand. No matter: let the truth
Than own to her maid she put a ribbon on
Than Roland with his knights, at Roncesvalles.
Than Romney Leigh, who lives by diagrams,
Than she pains me. Pains me!but wherefore pained?
Than sorrow, I rose quickly to depart;
Than still to take account too seriously
Than such a charming woman when she loves.
Than such a woman angry. Then a youth
Than sweet verbena, which, being brushed against,
Than taking, like your pensioners. Farewell.
Than that it thundered? If a cloud came down
Than that the victor Hours should scorn
Than this pure foreheads.
Than this, in which the choice, the will, the love,
Than touch such women with my finger-end!
Than touch the sacred curls of such a child.
Than track old Nilus to his silver roots,
Than underneath such dreary, dripping eaves.
Than up and down the new Jerusalem,
Than what we eat; and life, youve granted me,
Than when I tried a crown on and supposed....
Than when we came the last time; she will die.
Than you can live, or catch at. Stand aside,
Than, haply, that we, so, commend ourselves
Than, in my child, see other than ... my child.
Than, peradventure, if it had been more.

That `Loss is common to the race'
That all thy motions gently pass
That any irreverent fancy or conceit
That approbation of the general race,
That artists first must cater for their ease
That bear such fruit, are proud to stoop with it.
That beats its wings and tries to get away,
That beech leans down intoof which you said,
That birthday morning. Tis impossible
That birthday, poet, but you talked the right:
That bite betwixt the grassy uneven turfs
That blows in all the silence of its leaves,
That blushes one way, feels another way,
That bodies, leavened by the will and love,
That bosom seems to beat still, or at least
That branch of flowering mountain-gorse?‘So much?
That brawls, cheats, maddens, calculates, aspires,
That breathe a thousand tender vows,
That broke in utterance ... melted, in the fire;
That but to see him in the first surprise
That caps all Paris like a bubble. ‘Shall
That carpet-dusting, though a pretty trade,
That chances often: many a fervid man
That child to wander in a battle-field
That comes in power. On which, we thunder down,
That crown still,in the drawer there! twas the first;
That cruel Gigi might return his eyes
That danger ... thank Heaven for it.
That dashes from the gun-mouth, while the eye
That dies ere June, but vaunts itself allied
That dies not, but endures with pain,
That dogged me up and down the hours and days,
That door and nicked the lock, and shut it out,
That down came next days noon and caught me there
That draw you to her splendid whiteness, as
That Dumas would be chosen to fill up
That empty hand thrown impotently out
That even, may be worth some pains to know,
That ever they should laugh so. There was one
That every creature, female as the male,
That fair scroll-finis of a wicked book,
That feels a passionate torrent underneath
That few dare carp at Cæsar for being bald,
That funny pair of bedfellows! Miss Bell,
That gallant breaster, Romney. Strange it is,
That generates the likeness of itself
That God will have his work done, as you said,
That grief hath shaken into frost!
That half-dead, half-live body left behind
That he and I,despite a year or two
That he is taken in an eye-trap too,
That he should be the colder for his place
That He would stop his ears to what I said,
That he, except of love, is scarcely sick;
That he, in England, he, shall never learn
That he, in his developed manhood, stood
That headlong ivy! not a leaf will grow
That heap of misery at the hospital.
That here I should look up unto the stars
That here in Florence he should keep my thought
That hold a rhythmic thought, must ache perforce,
That holds the shadow of a lark
That Homers heroes measured twelve feet high.
That human spirits feel the human way,
That I besides, being well to do in life,
That I can bear to have you at my foot,
That I could wrong myself by such a doubt.
That I had heart still for another fear
That I have been an hour away.
That I myself had set them down as sins
That I should bear this stress of Tuscan noon
That I should meet it unsurprised. But now,
That I, so truculent in assumption once,
That I, who felt myself unworthy once
That Im the typic She. Away with Smith!
That if he sin not so, to damn himself,
That if I had known, that morning in the dew,
That if I left that Heart, to lighten it,
That if it can it there may bloom,
That keeps the shade-side of the thing it loves,
That last time of your coming,yesterday!
That lean with pretty faces into fairs.
That leaps for love, is active for resolve,
That leaves the sense of thunder.
That lets a bird out tenderly, the news
That letter.
That life develops from within. I say
That life develops from within.For me,
That little barley-cake you keep from him
That lived through all, as if one held a light
That loss is common would not make
That makes its own vocation! here, we have stepped
That makes the barren branches loud;
That Marian Erle, however lured from place,
That men may rise on stepping-stones
That men of science, osteologists
That men shall feel it catch them on the quick,
That mind and soul, according well,
That misbecame them in a holy place,
That morning, in my London painting-room;
That morning, too,no lark was out of tune;
That morning-truce of God would last till eve,
That moved us? When the will was read and done,
That murmur of the outer Infinite
That must have been: she came in suddenly,
That name the under-lying dead,
That nearly all young poets should write old;
That never knew the summer woods:
That night we spent between the purple heaven
That no truth henceforth seem indifferent,
That not a natural flower can grow on earth,
That other states, thought possible once, and then
That others, simply, should be kind to them.
That out of words a comfort win;
That peradventure I have come to grief;
That picture of my mother on the wall.
That Pope was sexagenarian at sixteen,
That pretty ladies might look beautiful,
That rather they are visiting my grave,
That rises upward always higher,
That Romney chose a wife, could write her name,
That Romney dared to hanker for your love,
That Romney gives us a fine actor-piece
That Romney groans and toils for. We catch love
That Romney Leigh had asked me for a wife,
That Romney Leigh had loved her formerly;
That Romney Leigh is honoured in his choice,
That Romney Leigh should think me worthy still
That Romney Leigh, my cousin, should espouse
That run along a witchs scarlet thread.
That scarce dare breathe, they are so beautiful?
That scorches in the piazza. After which,
That seemed as they would swallow her alive,
That seemed to motion for a smile in vain.
That seems as if it grew from some brown rock,
That sets the past in this relief?
That Shadow waiting with the keys,
That shake the ashes of the grave aside
That shall be in a month? you ask? nor guess?
That she looked only on her child, who slept,
That she should walk beside him on the rocks
That she, too, in that Eden of delight
That shook the thunder in a certain cloud,
That shuts the heavens conventual secrets up
That sing like poets, till their hearts break, ... sing
That sittest ranging golden hair;
That sleeps or wears the mask of sleep,
That slowly, faintly, with long breaths that marked
That slurs our cruel streets from end to end
That so much she should love me. A wise man
That so you may not lose, however lost
That so, in gravity and holy calm,
That so, the poet and philanthropist,
That sometimes he should seem to sigh my way;
That souls were dangerous things to carry straight
That spirit of hers had gone beyond the address,
That stares out from her large blind dial-eyes,
That strikes by night a craggy shelf,
That such a love could scarcely raise them up
That such a passionate rain would intercept
That such as you, indeed, should analyse?
That such perdition should oertake a man
That suns should dare to shine when God himself
That swan-like supernatural white life,
That sweeps with all its autumn bowers,
That swings along my veins, is strong enough
That swung their rankling bells against her brain;
That takes the sunshine and the rains,
That this, this letter ... unread, mark,still sealed,
That thou hadst touch'd the land to-day,
That thou should'st fail from thy desire,
That thus I love you,or but one through love?
That took the gaps of any imperfect phrase
That treason of false witness in my blush,
That trickles from successive galaxies
That tries its feeble ineffectual breath
That turns upon the sea. ‘Its always so!
That twinkle into green and gold:
That unity of Bests. No best, no God!
That Vincent did, before he chose his wife
That Vincents therefore, ‘sorry. Why, of course,
That wants loves colour in the grey of time.
That was trial enough
That we, who would be somewhat clean, must sweep
That we, whose spirit-sense is somewhat cleared,
That with his piping he may gain
That withered up the flowers before my face,
That Wolff, those Platos: sweep the upper shelves
That writhed toward heaven along the devils trail,
That wronged the grass between it and the road,
That you should weep for this account, not you!
That you, Aurora, with the large live brow
That you, sole offspring of an opulent man,
That youre a grand wild creature of the woods,
That youre my cousins wife. Youve gambled deep
That, as one stops a hole upon a flute,
That, boiling cabbage for the fast-days soup,
That, clinging round his neck, she pulls him down
That, flashing out in any looking-glass
That, having done it, she was fain to think,
That, if we say a true word, instantly
That, just because he loved me over all,
That, putting out his hand to touch this ark,
That, putting questions where his Marian lodged,
That, saying ‘I am thine to love and use,
That, since I know myself for what I am,
That, though a rag itself, it looks as well
That, when alls done, all tried; all counted here,
That, when the next shall come, the men of that
That, with him, I were virtuouser than you
That, worked on by some shrewd perfidious tongue,
that.
Thats bitter and convincing: after that,
Thats called the woman merely. I will write
Thats capable of worship, love, and loss;
Thats coming. Reverence for the young, I cry.
Thats Eglinton of Eglinton, Lord Howe.
Thats etiquette with women, obviously
Thats fatal!And you call it being lost,
Thats fingered by said public, fifty years,
Thats God! the best men are not quite as good
Thats hard to understand, for Englishmen
Thats hard, my critic Belfair! Sowhat next?
Thats higher than we? is all a dismal flat,
Thats killed, mayhap. I did misdoubt, at first,
Thats love! He takes it up, and dresses it,
Thats Marian Erles,what noble friend of yours
Thats my misfortune!I submit to it
Thats neither mans nor womans, but just Gods;
Thats otherwise than fetid. All success
Thats plain. And if hes ‘conscious of my heart ...
Thats prodigy. The lightning strikes a man,
Thats quiet, guarded! though she hold it up
Thats really loss! and passable impudence.
Thats sad, Im thinking.
Thats true!Though Lady Waldemar was kind,
Thats well. And who knows but, long years ago,
Thats womanly, past doubt, and not ill-moved.
Thats worn as bold and open as a smile,

The ‘vale et plaude came, too, with effect,
The academic law convinced of sin;
The act, the presence, my hand upon his arm,
The ages name is. God himself, with some,
The ancient mother-church would fain still bite,
The angel intercedes. He shook his head
The antithesis is human. Harken, dear;
The apocalypse is drawing to a close.
The apocalypse, by a Longus! poring on
The apostle. Ay, and while your common men
The apothecary looked on once a year,
The application in a womans hand,
The archetypal Beauty out of sight,
The argent angels in the altar-flare
The arms of that same Marian clasped a thing
The Articles ... the Tracts against the times,
The artists instinct in me at the cost
The artists part is both to be and do,
The artists also, are idealists,
The ash has livelier verdure than the yew;
The ashes, smouldering in me, were thrown out
The aunt is at your elbow.‘Lady Maud,
The axes to the legendary woods,
The beautiful for barley.And, even so,
The best of your conventions with his best,
The birds not moved, that pecks at a spring-shoot;
The birds must sing against us, and the sun
The blessed unaccustomed trees and fields,
The blind man walks wherever the dog pulls,
The blind mechanic motion sets itself
The blood of mine was still, except for grief!
The blossomed offshoot from my thorny life,
The blue of heaven is larger than the cloud;
The body of our body, the green earth,
The body proving spirit, as the effect
The bodys satisfaction and no more,
The boiling town keeps secrets ill; Ive known
The bones in the family-vault with ugly death.
The book brought down entire the bright June-day,
The book does honour to the sex, we hold.
The book has some truth in it, I believe:
The book lived in me ere it lived in you;
The book, toopass it. ‘A good book, says he,
The book-club, guarded from your modern trick
The boy is generous like him, and prepared
The bread of man indeed made all his life,
The bread we worked and prayed for,crumble it
The breast were closer covered, and the sight
The bride comes! Here she comes, in a stream of milk!
The bride, at last!
The bruises sore about her wretched soul,
The builder surely saved by any means!
The burr of three or four who really hear
The burrowing, groping effort, whence the arm
The buskin, which he rose upon and moved,
The butchers boy on horseback. Often, too,
The cadenced hum of such, and capable
The call to church; the broken, sad, bad dream
The captive void of noble rage,
The carriage stood to take me and said low,
The case afloat, and would not let it go,
The case as you conceive it,leave you room
The cat mews, or the milch-cow gives us milk:
The cataracts of her soul had poured themselves,
The cataracts of this loud transition-time,
The catholic, apostolic, mother-church,
The cattle huddled on the lea;
The cause: we, meantime, being too grossly apt
The chaffering swallow for the holy lark.
The chairs and thrones of civil power?
The chalice of the grapes of God;
The chambers emptied of delight:
The chances are that, being a woman, young,
The chariots, horsemen, footmen, all the host,
The charitable peasants gave me bread
The charming woman there
the cheeks, chiefly. Pass it to me now;
The chestnut pattering to the ground:
The Christ himself had been no Lawgiver,
The church,and by the church, I mean, of course,
The circle of the sciences, because
The city lay along the ample vale,
The city swims in verdure, beautiful
The civil conscriptions and lay monasteries
The civilisers spade grinds horribly
The clause set up a hundred years ago
The clay, Christ laid upon their eyelids when,
The clean white morning dresses.
The clear-eyed Heavens, a chosen minister
The colour of my hairhe cannot tell,
The common law, by which the poor and weak
The conscious skies and all their daily suns,
The constant and inviolable stars
The country that produces in these times
The course I took, the work I did. Indeed,
The crammed aisles heave and strain and steam with life
The creature who looks inward to himself,
The creature who stands front-ward to the stars,
The creeds, from Athanasius back to Nice,
The critics cried out on the falling off,
The critics say that epics have died out
The cruel yellow morning pecked at her
The curls before our eyes, may see at least
The cygnet finds the water; but the man
The cypress alley, like a restless ghost
The daily burden for the back.
The damps break out on me like leprosy,
The Danube to the Severn gave
The dark a-mutter round him? not a child!
The darken'd heart that beat no more;
The daylight, holding candles,compliments,
The days went by. I took up the old days
The day-sun dazzling in his limpid eyes,
The dead had ended gossip in, and stood
The Deads provision on the rivers couch,
The deaf blue sky that brings the roses out
The dear name on the blade which bites at us!
The deepsI lost breath in my soul sometimes,
The dent of her small shoe. The foiled police
The dentists teeth at the corner, in pale rows,
The Devil himself scarce trusts his patented
The Devil only has done it, and his heirs,
The devils most devilish when respectable.
The dewy kiss thats very sure to come
The difference lies in the honour, not the work,
The difference was the miracle, said she.
The difficult blue heights. A woman lives,
The dimple in the cheek had better gone
The divine Breath that blows the nostrils out
The doctor woke and found me with ‘the frogs
The dogs are on usbut we will not die.
The door-key in her hand, prepared to go
The Dorias long pale palace striking out,
The double-rose of our Italian moons,
The drama, I would fear to keep it down
The dream of doing good to ... me, at least,
The driver shouting to the lazy team
The drowsy silence of the exhausted day
The dumb derision of that grey, peaked face
The dust of golden lilies on her feet,
The dust of him I shall not see
The dust of the actual.Ah, your Fouriers failed,
The dust of the actual: and your Fouriers failed,
The earliest of Auroras!
The earth being felt unstable ground so soon
The echoing galleries, half a half-mile long,
The effect was. I, a little child, would crouch
The elemental nutriment and heat
The end of woman or of man, I think
The ends, through speaking unrequited loves,
The English have a scornful insular way
The English, Betsies, Saras, by the score.
The event proved,for you went more opposite
The evil is upon us while we speak;
The eyelids creeping over the blue balls,
The fables worse than Hamlets, Ill concede.
The face half-sketched, and slurred; the eyes alone!
The face, Sir Blaise?intensely calm and sad,
The faculty of vision from the roots,
The faiths the want. Dear cousin, give me faith,
The Falcons,of the lover who for love
The far-off interest of tears?
The fashions of the day to please the day;
The faster for his love. And love was here
The faster still, the farther! you must know
The fate was clear and close; it touched my eyes;
The fates deny us if we are overbold:
The feeble blood, the heavy-headed grief, ...
The felons iron, say, and scorn the mark
The fever gone, the wasted face extinct
The feverish gad-fly pricks me up and down,
The field, the chamber, and the street,
The fierce denouncing whistle wailing on
The figs grow black as if by a Tuscan rock,
The filials thankless, the fraternals hard,
The fine dust of most subtle courtesies.
The fine lord meant no good by her, or us.
The fire wants fuel, the very wolf wants prey;
The firmaments, the strata, and the lights,
The first book first. And how I felt it beat
The first breath drawn; but, in this tramping life,
The first foundations of that new, near Day
The first grave-digger proves it with a spade,
The first place,as if fearful that Gods saints
The first stir in the arras for a rat,
The five Miss Granvilles? always dressed in white
The flames through all the casements pushing forth,
The flat experience of the common man,
The flats I had never climbed from, could perceive
The flocks all scattered,is more laudable
The Flower of Heaven so vainly overhangs,
The foolish green one even.Ah, I think,
The fools of habit, sweeter seems
The foreign hedgeless country, lone and lost,
The foreign shore, the shameful house, the night,
The forest crack'd, the waters curl'd,
The form, through seeing the light. I lived, those days,
The formless, nameless trunk of every man
The friend I love ... as friends love.
The fruit you planted in your foreign loves!
The full weight of his soul,‘I ask for love,
The full-veined, heaving, double-breasted Age:
The full-voiced rhetoric of those master-mouths.
The future generations lie on us
The gallery-door with a burden. Say heavens bolt,
The game, to adore,we have resources still,
The garden-gate, the childrens playground, up
The gesture saying so tenderly, ‘My own.
The gesture was heroic. If his hand
The glittering boulevards, the white colonnades
The glittering haze of that prodigious rain,
The goats whose beards are sprouting down toward hell,
The gods may laugh, and Shakspeare; Dante smiled
The golden flood of moonlight unaware
The golden spray of multitudinous worlds
The golden stars from heavens embroidered stole,
The good of beauty, sung and taught by them,
The good they meant me. O my God, my God!
The gossip would be seen through at a glance
The government is slipping from his hand,
The gracious lady paid a visit first,
The grand first Master. Pleasant walks! for if
The grandiose red tulips, which grow wild,
The grass cut short, the weather changed, too late,
The great below clenched by the great above;
The great red stone upon my sepulchre,
The Greeks said grandly in their tragic phrase,
The green fields melted, wayside trees fell back
The green lane,then they leave it in the pit,
The grief of every stranger, hes not like
The ground must hurt him,it was writ of old,
The ground seemed cut up from the fellowship
The growing drama has outgrown such toys
The hair, too, ran its opulence of curls
The hand of a seducer....
The hand of an old friendship, caught from it
The hand that gives, has still a soul behind
The happy violets hiding from the roads
The harmless opal snakes, and large-mouthed frogs,
The harvest at wet seasons,or, at need,
The having to thank God for such a joy!
The headache is too noble for my sex.
The healthy odorous earth,I missed, with it,
The heaping of the years work on the days,
The hearers soul through hurricanes of notes
The heart in them was just an embryos heart,
The heart that never plighted troth
The hearts sweet scripture, to be read at night
The heavens and earth have set me, since I changed
The heavens were making room to hold the night,
The heaviest grave-stone on this burying earth.
The heir came over on the funeral day,
The hem of such, before twas caught away
The hidden farms among the hills, breathed straight
The hieroglyphic of material shows,
The highest, holiest manhood, thou.
The hills are crumpled plains,the plains, parterres,
The hoes, of course, are on us. So she said.
The honest earnest man must stand and work;
The honourable ribbon of his name,
The horizon, red twixt steeples in the east,
The horses in the street can spatter her!
The hot committees, in and out the House,
The hours too late for catching even moths,
The house went out.
The hues and shapes of aspectable life,
The human-hearted man I loved,
The humours of the peccant social wound
The idea of a knife cuts real flesh;
The incoherencies of change and death
The inner life informed the outer life,
The innocent white milk in us is turned,
The intermediate time, undoing themselves
The interval between the wish and word,
The intimate presence carrying in itself
The iron rule of womanly reserve
The irrecoverable child-innocence
The irregular line of elms by the deep lane
The ivy on my forehead, light as air.
The jewels of their gracious virtues worn,
The joy would set me like a star, in heaven,
The Judgment-Angel scarce would find his way
The June was in me, with its multitudes
The kind remains. And then, the harder truth
The kissing Judas, Wolff, shall go instead,
The knaves who win so, and the fools who lose;
The knowledge of a thing implies the thing;
The lading of a single pain,
The lady came, she looked more beautiful,
The lady had been ailing ever since,
The lady never was a friend of mine,
The lady nursed him when he was not well,
The lady on my arm is tired, unwell,
The Lady Waldemar had missed her tool,
The Lamia-woman,and I, write to him
The lane was; sunk so deep, no foreign tramp
The largesse of a silver river down
The last charm in the cauldron, the whole court
The last day shutting twixt its dawn and eve,
The last red leaf is whirl'd away,
The last sea-salt left in me.
The last sight left to me
The last words, haughtily said, were tremulous.
The latter loudest. And by such a time
The laugh of sad and innocent souls, that breaks
The leathery tongue turned back into the throat:
The lesser griefs that may be said,
The letter of the Lady Waldemar.
The letter to me by his friend Lord Howe
The letter written, I felt satisfied.
The liberal open country and the close,
The life that almost dies in me;
The light broke in so: it meant that then, that?
The light upon his eyelids pricked them wide,
The lighted windows of thy fair June-heaven
The linnet born within the cage,
The lion in me felt the keepers voice,
The literal unities of time and place,
The little ants food rather? But a man
The little creature almost loves me now,
The little lark reached higher with his song
The little naked feet drawn up the way
The little shepherd-maiden, eight years old,
The long bare rooms, and stare out drearily
The long hair swathed about her to the heel,
The long result of love, and boast,
The long weeks passed on without consequence.
The long, steep, narrow stair twixt broken rail
The lord-lieutenant looking down sometimes
The loud sum of the silent units. What,
The love from which it grew, in strength and heat,
The love within us and the love without
The low brow, the frank space between the eyes,
The low couch where I leaned, the table near,
The low vines and green wheat, crying ‘Take the girl!
The lowness of the present state,
The magic circle, with the mutual touch
The maker burnt the darkness up with His,
The man had baffled, chafed me, till I flung
The man I held as half-divine;
The man most man, with tenderest human hands,
The man must hear her, though he love her not,
The market-gardens thickened, and the long
The marriage-bells of Romney must be loud,
The marts and temples, the triumphal gates
The match up from the doubtful place. At once
The meal enough! if Ugolinos full,
The means are excellent; but the man, the man
The measure he had taken of my height:
The melancholy desert must sweep round,
The memory mixes with the vision, spoils,
The men who are prating, too, on their side cry,
The mere mans voice with all its breaths and breaks
The microcosm, the adding up of works;
The miller in his cart, a mile or twain,
The ministers in church might say the same;
The mission failed, we all do fail and lie
The moil of death upon them. What a sight!
The monies, by the ladys liberal grace,
The moon is surely somewhere in the sky;
The more the poet shall be questionable,
The more unquestionably comes his book!
The morning after spring-tide, as the trace
The morning and the evening made his day.
The most pretended. Over-proud of course,
The most unclean got courage and approach
The mother in me has survived the rest,
The mothers rapture slew her. If her kiss
The mothers special patience, lived and grew;
The moths, with that great overpoise of wings
The motivethen, to catch his eyes in hers,
The mouth and heard it sigh, he raised her up,
The mouth was, though the milky little teeth
The murmur of a happy Pan:
The Muse I pulled my heart out from my breast
The music interrupted.
The music of an organ, out of church?
The music soars within the little lark,
The mystic motions which in common moods
The mythic oaks and elm-trees standing out
The nail that holds the wood, must pierce it first,
The Name down on us from the thunder-shelf,
The names of bird and insect, tree and flower,
The naming of the wedding-day next month,
The natural creature labours, sweats and frets.
The naturals impossible;no form,
The nerve revolted. Tis the same even now:
The new wife vile, to make the husband mad?
The next chair vacant, by his ‘men in us.
The next day, we took train to Italy
The next step saves you! I was flushed with praise,
The next week passed in silence, so the next,
The night came drizzling downward in dark rain;
The night had passednot lifes night. She was ware
The noble ladies stood up in their pews,
The noble people,though the tyrannous sword
The nobler and ignobler. Ay, but you
The noise of life begins again,
The noon was hot; the air scorched like the sun,
The official guest and witnesses withdrawn,
The old miraculous mountains heaved in sight,
The old rooks had already fled too far,
The only speakers of essential truth,
The only teachers who instruct mankind,
The open-hearted A, the liberal sweep
The Oread in it has a Naiads heart
The other sum there is another sum,
The others took occasion to laugh out,
The out-door world with all its greenery.
The outspread city straight toward Fiesole
The overseer of the parish? Do we keep
The pain of pity in the blush he has made
The painter drew it after she was dead;
The painter symbolises unawares
The palm stands upright in a realm of sand.
The palpitating angel in his flesh
The pamphlets, ‘Arguments, ‘Collective Views,
The paper up and down, and down and up
The parcel-man, the doublet of the flesh,
The passions loose and draggling in the dirt
The path by which we twain did go,
The patient earth was singed an acre round;
The patient needle till it spilt the thread,
The peasants, gathering brushwood in his ear,
The pedlar stopped, and tapped her on the head
The peevish turn his voice took,‘Silly girls,
The perfect joy of married suited pairs,
The perfect round which fitted Venus hand
The pistil of a water-lily draws,
The pitiful black kerchief round her neck
The Pittis palace-front is drawn in fire;
The poems made on their chivalric bones.
The poet looks beyond the book he has made,
The poet suddenly will catch them up
The poet, the speaker, he expands with joy;
The point here. I but only think, you see,
The point of passionate fragrance; and hard by,
The point we come to. Heres a proof of gift,
The polytheists have gone out in God,
The poor lip
The poor right of a mouse in a trap, to squeal,
The poor sad snowdrop,growing between drifts,
The poor-club exercised her Christian gifts
The potage,both secured to every man;
The praise that comes to constancy.'
The prettier for its lining of fair rose;
The prettiest haunt in Paris, and make sure
The pretty baby who was near asleep,
The pricking of the map of life with pins,
The primroses run down to, carrying gold,
The prospects were too far and indistinct.
The proudest and most delicate heart alive,
The public blames originalities,
The public scarcely cared to climb the book
The pure place and the noble heart, to take
The purple and transparent shadows slow
The rains had swelled too large: it could mean that?
The range uneven, the points of sight obscure,
The reading that I never read at all,
The reason they grew moist.
The reasons ready master, angel, friend,
The rest are like it;those Olympian crowns,
The rest her face speaks for her.Then we went.
The rest in order, ... last, an amethyst.
The rest is lost. I do but stand and think,
The rest shall please you. What she can, in me,
The rest sit round it, and pluck blackberries,
The rest to trail. A Christian socialist,
The rhymes for love,and thats not love, my lord.
The rhymes upon your mountains of Delight.
The rich take up the same cry for themselves,
The right words after wrong ones. Ah, the man
The rising painter, Vincent Carrington,
The risks still worse upon the modern stage:
The river of life again, with commerce-ships
The river trailing like a silver cord
The river, just escaping from the weight
The rooks are blown about the skies;
The room does very well; I have to write
The room she sate in.
The roses with that face?
The rs like thorns, to make it smooth enough
The ruin did not hurt me as it might,
The rulers of our art, in whose full veins
The rustling of your vesture through my dreams
The sacrificial goat, for Bacchus slain,
The sad mechanic exercise,
The sadness of your greatness fits you well:
The salt sea-water passes by,
The same alive. In very deed a face
The same as life-heat, to be accurate;
The same Aurora of the bright June day
The same he wrote to,anybodys name,
The same, the whole creations groaning for!
The same, with fifty various instances.
The scimitar of ever-shining sea,
The seasons books in drear significance
The seasons bring the flower again,
The sense of all the graves!... thats terrible
The sense of duty gave her dignity:
The sense was in her,Lady Waldemar
The sensual element, which, with a back wave,
The sevenfold heavens unfolding all their gates
The seventh floor back, or else the hospital:
The Shadow cloak'd from head to foot,
The Shadow sits and waits for me.
The sheep-walk reaches!leave the thing to me.
The shelves of heaven with burning thunderbolts,
The shepherds heart-blood ebbed away into,
The shifted ship ... to Sydney or to France ...
The shock had harmed her. Something in his tone
The short way from us.Then, a measured speech
The sight of the great lime-tree on the lawn,
The sign too, hold the tender fingers fast,
The silence lengthened till it pressed. I spoke,
The silver quiver worn off on his hair.
The simulation of the painted scene,
The singers shall have help of Him, not last.
The sinless babe that should be in a month,
The Six-day Worker, working still in us,
The skies themselves looked low and positive,
The small fair face between the darks of hair,
The smile died out in his eyes
The smile rose in his eyes again, and touched
The smoothness of the action,then half bowed,
The so much liver, lung, integument,
The social questionby one handleleaves
The souls the way. Not even Christ Himself
The sound of the trumpets, when the trumpets blow
The sound of waters. There he stood, my king!
The speakable, imaginable best
The special form, with us, being still the thing.
The special theory: not a soul content
The spices of their tender youth heaped up,
The Spirit ever witnessing in ours,
The spirit, from behind this dethroned sense,
The spiritual beyond it,fixes still
The spiritual significance burn through
The squire speaks to you nowthe squires too good;
The star winks there, so many souls are born,
'The stars,' she whispers, `blindly run;
The stars, struck dumb and washed away in dews
The statuette on the console, of young Love
The steep snow-bosses of that shield of God
The steep stair somewhat justified.
The still house seemed to shriek itself alive,
The stitch, and mused how Romneys face would look,
The strain and struggle both of body and soul,
The strangers touch that took my fathers place,
The strata ... granite, limestone, coal, and clay,
The stronger for the distance. If he had loved,
The student flinched,
The sudden blow of it came down, till all
The sudden blush devours them, neck and brow;
The sudden revulsion in the blazing house,
The summer foliage out in a green flame
The sun came, saying, ‘Shall I lift this light
The sun is silent, but Aurora speaks.
The sun shall shine to melt it: leave it there.
The sun shines,ay, and melancholy books,
The sunbeam strikes along the world:
The sweat of labour in the early curse
The sweet safe corner of the household fire
The swines propulsion toward the precipice,
The swines road, headlong over a precipice,
The swooning sickness on the dismal sea,
The talk of charming women? I, at last,
The tangled hedgerows, where the cows push out
The tare runs through the farmers garnered sheaves;
The tears you stopped, which fell down bitterly,
The terrible people, old and poor and blind,
The terrors and compunctions of our souls,
The thing I understood so, than the thing
The thing she bade me, without heed to a thing
The thing was plainhe was not wrong a line;
The things too common.
The thinkers scout it, and the poets abound
The thought of how your father thought of you
The three-hour speeches from the members seat,
The thrilling, solemn voice, so passionless,
The thrilling, solemn, proud, pathetic voice.
The thrilling, tender, proud, pathetic voice.
The thrushes still sang in it.At which word
The thunder fell last week, and killed a wife,
The tide flows down, the wave again
The time is done for facile settings up
The tool-wright, laughing creature. Tis enough:
The topmost altar-stair, and tried to speak,
The tortoise, cold and hard, to drop on thee
The touch of change in calm or storm;
The traveller hears me now and then,
The trees stand stiff and still at time of frost,
The trees too green, reproach too natural
The trees, round, woolly, ready to be clipped;
The truth is not afraid of hurting you.
The truth is, I am grown so proud with grief,
The tumult!the last sound was ‘Pull him down!
The two-fold manner, in and outwardly,
The type with mortal vision, to pierce through,
The undeniable lineal mouth and chin,
The uneven pavement; while a woman, rouged
The universe shall henceforth speak for you,
The universe turned stranger, for a child.
The unpopular but necessary tax
The upbreak of the fountains of my heart
The upper windows partly were unglazed
The urgency and yearning of my soul,
The valley of Arno holding as a hand
The Vallombrosan mountains to the right,
The vase of lilies, Marian pulled last night,
The verb being absent, and the pronoun out?
The veriest slave who drops in Cairos street,
The very English, here, must wait to learn
The very first time I lost step of yours,
The very heat of burning youth applied
The very lamb left mangled by the wolves
The very last word which I said, that day,
The very source and fount of Day
The very women pelt their souls in mud
The vicar preached from ‘Revelations, till
The vigorous sun would catch it up at eve
The vileness of her kindred: through her heart,
The vintage plains and pastoral hills in sight!
The violet of his native land.
The visit might have taxed me. As it is,
The visual nerve is withered to the root,
The voices off with the uplands. On. Mad fear
The wards of this great key, the natural world,
The way of grand dull Odyssean ghosts
The way to rear up children, to be just,
The way we went. Good morning, Mister Leigh;
The way, and I, as by a narrow plank
The weather-signs of loveyou love this man.
The well-born,on the right, the merest mob,
The white roads curled as if she burnt them up,
The white strait bed, with others strait and white,
The white walls, the blue hills, my Italy,
The white-veiled rose-crowned maidens holding up
The whole creation in my little cup,
The whole position from your point of sight.
The whole strong clamour of a vehement soul
The whole sweet face; it looks upon my soul
The whole temporal show related royally,
The whole work bettered, of the previous six!
The whole world knows, since first, a nominal man,
The whole world tugging at my skirts for help,
The wicked London tavern-thieves and drabs,
The wild pulsation of her wings;
The wild unrest that lives in woe
The wild-goats hoof-print on the loamy down,
The window and my soul, and let the airs
The window fixed you with its torturing eye,
The wine-skins, now and then, a little warped,
The winters bitter,but the summers green.
The wisdom of the few. Heroic dreams!
The woman ... and you stared upon the floor
The woman also; otherwise she drops
The woman had been with her, it appeared,
The woman looked immortal. How they told,
The woman named, came in to visit me.
The woman to be nobler than the man,
The women of the neighbourhood subscribed,
The wonder of their glorious brows and breasts,
The wonder would be if such innocence
The woodbine at my window, in and out,
The woodbine through the window, till at last
The word suits many different martyrdoms,
The words grown dangerous. In the middle age,
The words out fairly; let me prove the fact.
The words ... and how you lifted your white hand,
The words in which the noble offerings made,
The words that are not heard again.
The work advanced by the earliest blow. Take heart.
The work more withers. Young men, ay, and maids,
The works of women are symbolical.
The world of books is still the world, I write,
The world of books! Ah, you!you think it fine,
The world so marvellous kind, the air so hushed,
The world thinks; you have borne with me before,
The world was always evil,but so bad?
The world would hardly understand her case
The world, as head and heart make human life.
The world, were come to late, is swollen hard
The worlds Aurora who had conned her part
The worlds male chivalry has perished out,
The worm and beat her baby in revenge
The worse for being warm: all these things, writ
The worth of our work, perhaps.
The wrong he looks on. May I choose indeed
The Wye is hush'd nor moved along,
The year you came here, just before he died,
The yearling creature, warm and moist with life
The young man with the German students look
The young run on before, and see the thing
The youngest there until it shrunk and shrieked

their
Their age, not Charlemagnes,this live, throbbing age,
Their anthems to themselves, and leave you dumb.
Their chastity so darned with perfidy,
Their debtors. But I stopped them with a word;
Their eyes eat out with plague and poverty
Their flying words with flickering wild-fowl tails,
Their gingerbread for joy,than shift the types
Their household keys about a ladys waist,
Their keen air pricked her neck. She had lost her feet,
Their life by living out heart, brain, and nerve,
Their long-scored shadows on my villa-floor,
Their place should quicken with the elephant;
Their radiant faces upward, burn away
Their rapid insight and fine aptitude,
Their right of comprehending husbands talk
Their ringing circles of ecstatic tune,
Their salt upon your lips. The duomo-bell
Their skirts back, not to brush you in the street;
Their smoke toward heaven; the lime-tree scarcely stirred
Their sole work is to represent the age,
Their spheric limitations, swallowing up
Their whole weight half in indolence, and half
Their wings,which proves that light is good for moths,

then
Then at first,
Then back again before the house should stir.
Then bring out presently our saucer-full
Then bring your gauges. If the days works scant,
Then broke off in a rapid radiant smile
Then catching up her smile to ravishment,
Then drink away his soul into the dark
Then helps to sugar her bohea at night
Then home, with a bad headache and worse jest!
Then I rose.
Then I spoke.
Then imitation would be all in Art;
Then leave me,let me rest. Im dead, I say.
Then live, Aurora!
Then low and calm, as one who, safe in heaven,
Then might I find, ere yet the morn
Then quiet, with a sort of tremulous pride,
Then replied
Then she led
Then shook her curls down on her eyes and mouth
Then sighed again, again, less generously,
Then sighing as twere sighing the last time,
Then softly, as the last repenting drops
Then told my story out, of Romney Leigh,
Then why distrust me? Never tremble so.
Then, Io does not call it truth, but love?
Then, land!then, England! oh, the frosty cliffs
Then, least care have we for the crowns and goals,
Then, mark, be reverent, be obedient,
Then, putting into it something of disdain,
Then, something moved me. Then, I wakened up
Then, suddenly, a single ghastly shriek
Then, turning back on Marian, smiled to mark
Then, turning toward me, very slow and cold
Then, white and tranquil as a summer-cloud

There are men, move on without outriders,
There are, too, who believe in hell, and lie:
There are, who waste their souls in working out
There came an answer like a hurried dove
There drifted past him scarcely marked enough
There he glowed on me
There he lay, upon his back,
There is whats higher, in this very world,
There it is;
There might be truth betwixt us two, at least,
There sat the Shadow fear'd of man;
There seemed more true life in my fathers grave
There seemed no sin, no shame, no wrath, no grief.
There she paused, and sighed,
There she sate, my aunt,
There twice a day the Severn fills;
There would be nothing seen, for all the light;
There, a silver laugh
There, ended childhood: what succeeded next
There, I turned
There, Joves hand gripes us!For we stand here, we,
There, with some strange spasm
Theres a blot!
Theres danger that you beat yourself to death
Theres hope, Aurora.
Theres hope. The man here, once so arrogant
Theres many a papist she, would rather die
Theres more than passion goes to make a man,
Theres no lack, neither, of Gods saints and kings,
Theres none can like a nettle as a pink,
Theres nothing high which has not first been low;
Theres room twixt him and you, for flirting fans
Theres something in it, haply, of your fault,
Theres too much abstract willing, purposing,
Theres work for wives as well,and after, straw,

These crowds are very good
These crushed their delicate rose-lips from the smile
These dry bones live, thought Louis Philippe once,
These hideous streets, these graves, where men alive,
These leaves that redden to the fall;
These Leighs! our best blood running in the rut!
These unchaste girls are always impudent.
These victims, one by one! till, one by one,

they
They add up nature to a naught of God
They are but broken lights of thee,
They are charmed so, they forget to look behind
They are fair and gracious; ay, but not like you,
They are fair, I said; so fair, it scarce seems strange
They are not idle as so many are,
They break beside: were parting,parting,ah,
They bring us up, to trick us.‘Go it, Jim,
They burnt Leigh Hall; but if, consummated
They call the Genius of the Vatican,
They came out like the stars, and shone on her
They can stop flying: butterflies, that bear
They cannot hear each other speak.
They certainly felt bettered unawares
They clogged the streets, they oozed into the church
They did it perfectly: a thorough work,
They feared my eyes and loosed me, as boys might
They feel it almost an immoral thing
They flared up with! now, nevermore theyll twit
They had burnt instead a star or two, of those
They had not set there. Who had set it there?
They have drawn too near the fire of life, like gnats,
They have their day and cease to be:
They hide in cellars, not to make you mad
They hum the tune of comfort, though themselves
They just can drop their lids a little. In fact,
They know a simple, merry, tender knack
They laid him by the pleasant shore,
They lap the lucent margins as babe-gods,
They live too far above, that I should look
They may teach thinking, to a maiden-aunt
They met still sooner. Twas a year from thence
They might as well be written on the dust
They might as well go out into the fields
They might have had their pennyworth out of her,
They might say something. Nay, the very dog
They must have mantles, stitched with twenty silks,
They must wear blinkers, ignore facts, suppress
They need be glad, of course, in clasping such:
They pause at now, to build it to a row.
They pick much oakum; earths fanatics make
They put down a subscription-cheque,if once
They rend the seamless mist and stand up bare,
They saw a light at a window now and then,
They say God made it first, but, if He did,
They say hes very busy with good works,
They see, for mysteries, through the open doors,
They seem to scorch the blue air into holes
They smell like ... ah, I see her writing back
They split the amaranth velvet-boddice down
They started; he forgot her with his face,
They stood: I watched beyond that Tyrian belt
They strike from,it is hard to stand for art,
They struck their blows at virtue. Oh, tis hard
They tell me Lady Waldemar mixed drinks
They tell me, my dear father. Broader brows
They threaten conflagration to the world
They top the poor street-walker by their lie,
They trembled in dilation. O delight
They turn indeed; but then they turn upon
They were but men!his Helens hair turned grey
They were not elephants but mastodons:
They will, in heavenbut meantime, on the earth,
They wish them finest?
They would not trick us into choosing wives,
They would so naughtily find out their way
Theyd have, in fact, to travel ten miles off
Theyll do your business with the heavens, be sure:
Theyll tell you he lost count of Homers ships
Theyre sorry, neither. What is done, is done,
Theyve heard the Dead a-ticking like a clock

This
This apple of life, and cut it through the pips,
This babe would steal off from the mothers chair,
This cannot be a secret.
This change and separation. Sparrows five
This dark of the body, issuing on a world
This daughter of the people. Such soft flowers,
This drovers daughter shes not pretty, he swears
This earth had been the Paradise
This fellow would make weakness weak,
This Florence sits upon me easily,
This flower has never as much to say to you
This forfeit presence of a gracious friend,
This game of head and heart. Life means, be sure,
This gentry is not honest with the poor;
This girl of Leighs? ‘No,wait! twas Mrs. Brookes,
This great despair,to stand before your face
This grows absurd!too like a tune that runs
This guelder-rose, at far too slight a beck
This hand may never, haply, open large,
This Head has all the people for a heart;
This hot, sick air! and how I covet here
This hurts most, this ... that, after all, we are paid
This ink runs thick ... we light girls lightly weep ...
This is life, this word is being said in heaven,
This is worst:
This Lady Waldemar? And, say, she held
This letter, for a reader half as learnd,
This life here, undeveloped yet to life
This light French people will not thus be driven.
This look of quiet flatters thus
This love just puts its hand out in a dream,
This lying smoothly in a bed to die.
This man, this image, ... chiefly for the wrong
This modern question of the poorthe poor:
This moment; Lucy wants a drink, perhaps.
This morning, my beloved, pardon it;
This night is softer than an English day,
This night, ... remember, where hearts slip and fall
This night,this night, which still to you is fair;
This palfrey pranced in harness, arched her neck,
This perfect solitude of foreign lands!
This poet of the nations, who dreams on
This poor weaned kid would run off from the fold,
This poor, good Romney. Love, to him, was made
This purples lined with the democracy,
This race is never grateful: from the first,
This reckoning up and writing down her talk
This Romney Leigh, so rash to leap a pale,
This rose of love, the wasp inside and all,
This shame, or glory? The light woman there
This skyey father and mother both in one,
This strikes me.If the public whom we know,
This sum, you say
This tiger shake his cage?does one of you
This verse in fire for ever! Tenderly
This virtuous act must have a patent weight,
This weakness. If, as I have just now said,
This woman breaks her social system up
this.

Those alabaster shoulders and bare breasts,
Those chiefly women, sprinkled round in blots
Those eyes, to-day,how overlarge they seemed,
Those marriage-bells I spoke of, sounded far,
Those noisy vaunters of their shallow streams
Those open caskets, with the jewels seen!
Those open eyes to wink once. What last sight
Those passed the salts with confidence of eyes
Those rafters, I who am born a Leigh,nor speak
Those savage, hungry dogs that hunt her down
Those stars above us, which I cannot see ...
Those virtuous liars, dreamers after dark,
Those years of education, to return
Those, faces! twas as if you had stirred up hell

Thou madest man, he knows not why,
Thou Marian; thourt no reputable girl,

Though armed against St. Michael. Many a crown
Though but so little as with a finger-tip,
Though foolish worldlings talk they know not what,
Though high and cold and only like a star,
Though I waste myself on doing. Long green days,
Though I were a man?
Though if a woman took one from the ledge
Though insolent your letter and absurd,
Though laid out in our coffins: pitiful!
Though love of beauty makes us timorous,
Though mine fail utterly. This social Sphinx,
Though neer so merry: Im perforce more wise,
Though not a breath should trouble it. Again,
Though not a hint of Abrahams bosom. Who,
Though reason and nature beat us in the face;
Though shrieked for by the shipwrecked,O my Dark,
Though something I have somewhat overdone,
Though somewhat faint. I clenched my brows across
Though still the July air came floating through
Though the outer eyes appear indifferent,
Though triply netted, need you glare at me?
Though twice a woman, shall be called a leech:
Though twice my cousin, and once Romney Leigh,
Though, like a drenched Noah on a rotten deck,
Though, since weve parted, I have past the grave!

through
Through a golden ring. I thought so. Foolishly,
Through a pothouse window while the drunken oaths
Through all dark facts. But pardon, pardon me,
Through all heroic duties? so far wrong,
Through all its quivering dewlaps: I was quelled
Through all the bristling fence of nights and days
Through all the cold, numb aching of my brow,
Through all the dismal faces that we make,
Through all the green hills to our fathers house,
Through all the heaving of impatient life
Through all the spilt saltpetre of the world.
Through all things upwards; that a twofold world
Through all this letter,conscious of your heart,
Through all, and curling loosely, both before
Through arrogance of nature,though I loved ...
Through being a mother?... then shes none! although
Through being a woman. And, for all the rest,
Through being beheld too close, is ill-discerned
Through being so proud; youre better; as for him,
Through bitter dutiesthat, I know she can;
Through bitter experience, compensation sweet,
Through brows and cheeks and chin, as if to find
Through chaster pulses. I speak steadily:
Through contraries of nature. He indeed
Through driving autumn-rains to find the sky.
Through edging over-rashly toward the light.
Through flowery poems as through meadow-grass,
Through Gods own barrier-hedges of true love,
Through half-built habitations and half-dug
Through ill-shut casements, making me more sad
Through intellectual culture? since indeed
Through meeting mine? in faith, she would not change:
Through much sea-sickness. The train swept us on.
Through my own bad shepherding: and could I choose
Through orbits of blue shadow, and my pulse
Through said mistakes being ventured in the gross
Through scorning nothing. You decry them for
Through secret windings of the afternoons,
Through simply being. Thus, twas granted me
Through sobs upon the foot, upon the ground
Through some wild gap, she was my mother, sir
Through stony vizors iron-barred, prepared
Through such a heap of generalised distress,
Through sudden ignorance of a common tongue.
Through sunlight and through moonlight evermore
Through the dusk of ages,theres no need to speak;
Through the intermittent pantings. Being observed,
Through the open arms of God. ‘Theres nothing great
Through the rage and roar
Through watchword phrases, jest or sentiment,
Through what he knew, and she, through what she felt,
Through which my cousin Romneys chimneys smoked
Through whom God touched me! I am not so lost

till
Till all my widow'd race be run.
Till all my widow'd race be run;
Till death has bleached their foreheads to the bone,
Till down upon the filthy ground I dropped,
Till God came on me, marked the place, and said,
Till God says, ‘Look! I charge you, seek me not,
Till Gods great fire.But make the best of time.
Till hate, so nourished, did exceed at last
Till I felt old; and then she counted me
Till men say, ‘Its too tedious.
Till night appeared more tolerable, just
Till none shall need inquire, ‘Whose child is this,
Till some one, who had nursed her as a friend,
Till such grow plainer to me than the French
Till such was in leone: I must fret
Till the last nightingale is tired of song,
Till then, but then I raised it, and it fell
Till, clash against us, comes a somebody
Till, some one breathing, all fell flat again;

To a bedside to tell people they must die
To a benefactor, to a generous man,
To a bishops prayer and see the way it goes;
To a Blessed Virgin.
To a dying man who will not pass the day,
To a fruit hung overhead? she sighed and sighed ...
To a girl of doubtful life, undoubtful birth,
To a larger bubble with his prophet-breath;
To a loyal woman, ‘Love and work with me,
To a noisy Tophet; and I drew ... costumes
To a perfect purpose. Oh, Im vexed, it seems!
To a point of moonlit, water down a well:
To a printing woman who has lost her place,
To a pure white line of flame, more luminous
To a sadder end,no matron-mother now
To a saner man than he, wheneer we talked,
To a scarlet kerchief caught beneath her chin
To a sick, inodorous light; my own endured:
To a sigh, repressed too. He went on to say
To a surer issue. Let us work, indeed,
To a trance of passive glory, you might see
To a voice not hers, nor yet that enemys,
To a wafer on the white speck on a wall
To a wicked house in France,from which she fled
To a woman.
To Aaron when he took it off to die.
To abolish evil nor attaint free-will.
To absorb most listeners, how I listened chief
To acquit me of the heaviest charge of all
To affront the blessed hillside drabs and thieves
To agonise the man I loveI mean
To all the country pastures. Tis even thus
To all the tender pricking of such leaves?
To an individualism of the Infinite,
To an unconjectured harmony of truth.
To any conscious spirit of a girl
To any mean and ordinary end,
To any one but me to give him help,
To ask, ‘Who is it that cries after us,
To austerity in the application of
To awe them backward! Ay, we are forced, so pent,
To banish mine as far as I should choose
To be a woman also.
To be apprehended near.
To be over-bold in speaking of myself,
To be so cruel,and I emptied out
To be so early watered by our brine.
To be the handmaid of a lawful spouse.
To be your love ... I never thought of that.
To be your slave, your help, your toy, your tool.
To be, as if you had not been till then,
To bear thro' Heaven a tale of woe,
To being straight levelled, scattered by his foot,
To better an intrigue; good friends, beside,
To better ends, or play in earnest. ‘Heavens,
To bite and tear me for my wicked deed
To blanch our faces like divided rocks,
To blow upon them with loud windy mouths
To both the heads of both my Danaës,
To bow down now the ruffs are off their necks
To bowl him down with jestings.There, she paused;
To break as softly as a sparrows egg
To break in laughter, as the sea along
To break the fall of womans impudence?
To breathe a long breath in the dewy night,
To breathe thee over lonely seas.
To breathe up more, and count her festive hours.
To breathe: ‘I think you were ill afterward.
To bring her to you for a womans kiss,
To bring the house a message,ay, and walked
To bring you ... I could scarcely choose but yield;
To brushing cobwebs? Well, but she and he
To build instead, a brothel ... or a prison
To build up public stores and magazines,
To buy your life is nearly impossible,
To call you brother, sister, or perhaps
To cap them with unreal remedies
To carry it oer a chasm of social ill,
To carry out his kindest word and thought
To carry so much dirt upon my shoe.
To carry the whole octave thats to prove
To carry to Australia where she had left
To catch attention,and their quiet mood,
To catch the dawn afloat upon the land!
To catch the death-strained eyes and comfort them,
To catch the indifferent eye of such a man,
To catch us undefended in the trap
To chalk its height on, wears a dog-chain round
To challenge observation, pioneer
To change the water for my heliotropes
To chirp and peck the letters from her mouth,
To choose from.
To clasp your hand, my Marian, owned as pure!
To Cleopatras breast, persistently
To consecrate the verdure. Some one said,
To cool the fever for him. Weve escaped
To cool this heat,a drop of the early dew,
To count the daisies upon dappled fields,
To creak i the wind and drive the world-crows off
To creep in somewhere, humbly, on your knees,
To creep so high up as to wet my feet.
To cure such. You have balsams.
To cymbals, Romney.
To dance with death, to beat the ground,
To dandle babies. Heres a hand, shall keep
To dazzle black her sight against the sky,
To deserts, to secure you, with a trap,
To devils, heightened beyond Lucifers,
To die and rot. Even so, Aurora, ends
To do good seemed so much his business,
To do it,claims her license in her work.
To do me good. Mark, there. We get no good
To do the thing we can, and not presume
To do their business and lead spirits up
To do you justice, youd not shrink to face ...
To dodge the sharp sword set against my life;
To draw in easier breath from larger air.
To draw me to this duty.
To draw my uses to cohere with needs,
To draw the new light closer, catch and cling
To drench the incapable throat and split the veins ...
To duchies or to dunghills, not an inch
To dust beneath his heel; though, even thus,
To each other, month by month, and year by year,
To eastward, in a hut, built up at night
To eat a marriage-feast on Hampstead Heath.
To eat the bishops wafer at the church;
To eat their ice at Donis tenderly,
To elemental freedomthus, my soul,
To embrace your orphaned life! fie, fie! But stay,
To enlarge the sum of human action used
To enrich them? pray instruct me how its done.
To escape the anguish of his eyes, and asked
To escape the burden of those eyes ... those eyes?
To evade the landlords eye, of mud and turf,
To evening, but some heart did break.
To exhaustion,sighing while she let the babe
To face and quell the beast there,take the soul,
To fashion all my life upon my thought,
To feed her eager child, who sucked at it
To feed the most untender of Christs lambs.
To feel from world to world, and charms
To feel his tooth in earnest turned short round
To feel how tenderly his voice broke through,
To feel so. My first husband left me young,
To feel the cold chin prick its dimples through
To fetch some help. They say theres help in heaven
To fight the rats of our society,
To fill a gap and keep out a strong wind,
To fill the chair up of my cousins wife,
To fill the ditches up twixt class and class,
To find a speckled bean, thats somehow specked,
To find mans veritable stature out,
To find their coming Bacchus. All the place
To find your hand, although were parting, dear.
To fire some holy taper with: Lord Howe
To fit its fortunes. There was one who looked
To fit the hand, that reaches but the knee?
To flare its ugly wrinkles out to shame,
To flatten and bake you to a wholesome crust
To flies even. ‘Sing, says he, ‘and teaze me still,
To flinch from modern varnish, coat or flounce,
To float its fabulous plumage safely down
To float upon it. ‘I had left my child,
To Florence, to resume this broken bond:
To flush his temples out so gloriously
To fly my fancies in the open air
To fold within her breast, and pore upon
To follow a mile after, wading up
To founder in the dark, while she sate still
To frame your greatness? you conceive so small?
To fret because its little. Twill employ
To full life and its needs and agonies,
To future generations! its sublime,
To general suffering. Heres the world half blind
To generous use? alas, and is it so,
To get at men excepting through their souls,
To get the least good or help meet for him,
To get them to some purer eminence
To get to work, and fill some clamorous mouths;
To give dismissal to a guest of hers,
To give me welcome. She stood straight and calm,
To give the witness of my presence and name
To give up much on each side, then take all.
To give you love ... still less. I gave you love?
To give, as first I scorned your power to judge
To go down half dead, half alive, I say,
To go down with ones soul into the grave,
To go out and be married in broad day,
To go straight home and hear her father pull
To God himself, who thinks of every one,
To God, and placed it, rounded to an oath,
To God, once,now they cannot, even with men,
To good-for-nothing people. But a wife
To grief itself? What, what, ... being beaten down
To guard that fair church, Buonarrotis Bride,
To hang the cobweb of their gossip out
To hang upon her ruins,and forgets
To hanker after a mere name, a show,
To happy issues. There are marquises
To harken the invocations of my kind,
To have a real mother, like some girls:
To have hastened by its beats the marriage-day,
To have her ‘no so cast into my teeth,
To have its hands too full of gifts to give,
To have only Gods curse on us, and not mans.
To have our books
To hear a confirmation in your voice ...
To hear a lecture at an institute:
To hear that Vincent was betrothed to Kate.
To hear the screech they fled with, though you saw
To heave its lowest dreg-fiends uppermost
To heaven, not her, until it tore my throat.
To help my pity. I beheld the world
To help the blind man stumbling. God forbid!
To help your outcast orphans of the world,
To her one advantage,as the mill wants grain,
To her sort of hate, to entertain it with;
To her soul, had reproduced itself afresh
To her, perpetual maidenhood,
To hide her make-mirth from the schoolmaster.
To hide some sweetness newer than last years
To himself,but, otherwise, to let them pass
To his very face ... he warmed his feet at it;
To hold and move them, if they will or no,
To hold it buzzing at the window-pane
To hold it,shadow of town and castle blurred
To hold my finger in the public ways,
To hold the lamp of human love arm-high
To hold the natural, as dogs a bone,
To hold the world-full woe. The human race
To hold their unweaned babies up in sight,
To hold together what he was and is.
To hollow out our weary hands to keep
To honour a chief-poet, folio-built,
To hop through court-yards with its right foot tied,
To hope by, when the world grows thick and bad,
To hound and hate a lie, from eyes like yours.
To humble creatures! When the fevers heat
To hunt the creatures into corners, back
To Imogen and Julietsweetest kin
To inaugurate the use of vocal life;
To incriminate possession. When he came
To indurate forms and systems! excellent bricks,
To ineffable inflatus: ay, the breath
To intercept the sunshine and your face.
To join his grandeur of ideal thought,
To join the dust she came from. Did I love,
To join to our confession ere we have done?
To joy, that even the kindest, seeing her,
To judge the whole too partially, ... confound
To justice and perfection, line by line,
To keep a crowd of lion-hunters off,
To keep a mounting saint uncanonised.
To keep and hearten: with some struggle, indeed,
To keep for love,a ribbon for the neck,
To keep Gods books for Him, in red and black,
To keep him from the light-glare, both his cheeks
To keep his hearth cold, make his casements creak
To keep it from quite breaking out of bounds:
To keep it from the mud. I learnt the use
To keep it in my eyes, as in my ears,
To keep its green feud up twixt them and you?
To keep me low and wise. Ah me, the vines
To keep men separate,using sorry shifts
To keep my booth in May-fair with the rest
To keep my honour pure. You face, to-day,
To keep out this Aurora. Ah, your north
To keep some thoughts down deeper in her soul,
To keep the mouths of all the godheads moist
To keep the pauses of the rhythmic sounds.
To keep them at the grand millennial height,
To keep them back from following the grey flight
To keep you, Romney Leigh, from saying more,
To keep your bird upon the blackthorn?
To keep your honour, as you count it, pure,
To kick like Britons,and made obstacles
To know he loved me to the depth and height
To know that some one needs you to be strong
To Lara, and what census of the year five
To learn you have a father up in heaven
To let it pass as such, and press on you
To let out the caged cricket on a tree,
To let out the rich medicative nard.
To let the perfect action take her part
To let the stars out slowly prophesied
To let them charge him with another pack.
To let your cousin, for a generous bent,
To light me forwards? Leaning on my face
To listen.
To live and have his being. But for you,
To live in, a pure heart to lean against,
To live mine straight out, vocally, in books;
To live with men and women! hed go mad,
To loathe the comb in winter, and desire
To London, to the gathering-place of souls,
To look back sadly on work gladly done,
To look into the swarthiest face of things,
To look on her that loves him well,
To lose my Proclus. Not for Florence, even.
To lose the sight and keep the doubt of this.
To lose this famous letter, which Sir Blaise
To love ... no more,since more can never be
To love anew? that Lady Waldemar
To love so much, the perfect round of love
To love what was more worthy than myself;
To loves grand sunrise. Small spheres hold small fires:
To Lucys home, to nurse her back to life
To make a good man, which my brother was,
To make a natural emphasis worth while:
To make a space to sphere my living verse.
To make believe it grows there. Look, my sweet,
To make earth over again,while Im content
To make Gods image! the despised poor earth,
To make him, thus, a less uneasy time
To make it comprehensible? Why, Leigh
To make it fine, and only spoil the book!
To make it vocal. While you ask of men
To make me sob until I vex the child.
To make my father sadder, and myself
To make my sabbath after working-days;
To make room for her. Then, her head grew vexed,
To make such ringlets. O my fathers hand,
To make the pictures. Let me bring the sketch.
To make the verse blaze after. I myself,
To make us merry on his marriage-morn,
To make you wholly easyshes not dead,
To many a flute of Arcady.
To Marian! and I do not think, besides,
To Marian, and was ready otherwise
To Marian, saying ‘And you? youre going, where?
To Marian? For even I could give as much;
To match her shoes, when I mistook the silks;
To me ... me? had I any right, ay, right,
To meet my kiss, as if requiting me
To melt you into passion.
To men who act and suffer. Better far,
To mercy and ministration,he, indeed,
To mince-meat of the very smallest talk,
To mingle with the bounding main:
To mount from sorrow to his heaven of love,
To mount the pile, as Indian widows do,
To move a body,it takes a high-souled man,
To move a body: it takes a high-souled man,
To move his comfortable island-scorn,
To move the masses ... even to a cleaner stye:
To name the colour. Too much hair perhaps
To no book-learning,she was ignorant
To no dishonour,diet still on mud,
To obliterate good words with fractious thumbs
To one ... no matter! I had sooner cut
To one clear harp in divers tones,
To other ways, from equal men. But so,
To others: through the days and through the nights,
To outward,so in life, and so in art,
To overcrow me with triumphant scorn
To own our compensations than our griefs:
To pain me! womans spite!You wear steel-mail;
To paint a crooked pollard and an ass,
To Paris, and you make no sign at all.
To pass so careless for the oranges!
To pause with a thrill, as if their cheeks had touched,
To pay the head-tax. You are fallen indeed
To pay your debts is scarcely difficult;
To Peter then, He speaks to us the same;
To pick up sympathies, opinions, thoughts,
To pin them on the grey side of this earth,
To play at art, as children play at swords,
To play his loudest gambol at my foot,
To pluck it out all bleeding with spent flame
To plunge into the mirror opposite,
To prick me to a pattern with her pin,
To prove a vain intention? Would I show
To prove just guilt, I thought, and stood there dumb;
To prove the power not else than by the pain.
To prove their soundness of humility.
To prove, if women do not think at all,
To pull you from the vile flats up to them;
To purify and end us. We talk, talk,
To push you to your place; so self-possessed
To put in words the grief I feel;
To put it on the table by her flowers,
To put more virtue in the new fine scarf
To put on when youre wearyor a stool
To put such music in it ‘Foolish girl,
To question God of His felicity?
To quicken a man. Forgive me. All my heart
To raise her to his embrace, escaping thence
To raise me to the subject, in a sketch
To rave: I would have married him so changed,
To reach the availing sense beyond that sound,
To reach the grassy shelter of the trees.
To read and meditate the thing I would,
To recommence the world on the old plan:
To rest beneath the clover sod,
To rest the better.
To rhyme the cry with which she still beats back
To right it visibly, a fingers breadth,
To ring with once being touched, I drew a wreath
To risk, in turn, a womans paradox,
To run up hill and meet the rising sun,
To save you at last from such a dreary end.
To say Im sorry. Dear Leigh, dearest Leigh!
To say so, its still foolisher were frank
To say to a courtier, ‘Pluck that rose for me,
To say what men dare say to women, when
To see a wrong or suffering moves us all
To see all England thrust you out of doors
To see and hear it tick. I could not sit,
To see another merry whom she loved.
To see by, as most others, and perhaps
To see if stone-cutter or lichen beat
To see in that south angle of the house
To see it down in figures on a page,
To see me wear the night with empty hands,
To see me, dear Aurora, if you had read
To see my darling on a good mans knees,
To see my face there, that she missed the plait:
To see near things as comprehensively
To see such sights as sexual prejudice
To see the face oft once more, and farewell!
To see the great house flare so ... oaken floors,
To see the tumult quelled. The men of law
To see the vacant chair, and think,
To see them laugh and laugh, and moil their texts;
To see this miracle, this Marian Erle,
To see this, almost moved myself to clap!
To see you, in your lovely morning-pride,
To seem deaf, answering chance-wise, yes or no,
To serve king David? who discerns at once
To set a tumbling birds-nest somewhat straight?
To set them trembling through a million leaves
To shake a common fellow by the fist
To shapeless endings. She let fall my hands,
To share my cup, to slumber on my knee,
To shine there, at the first loves covenant,
To show a pretty spirit, chiefly admired
To show ones sick and so be trod to dirt,
To show the crown, they said,‘a scarlet crown
To show them grey with all their centuries,
To show theyre ready to be married.‘Lower!
To show what cruel uncles we have been,
To shroud me from my proper scorn.
To signify the death which he should die
To silence in a corner. I am come
To sing itself and vex you;yet perhaps
To sit alone,
To sit and practise easy virtues on?
To slant the fifth autumnal slope,
To sleep and find corruption, cheek to cheek
To Sleep I give my powers away;
To slip down stairs through all the sleepy house,
To smile back to them. I had lost a friend
To smile or sigh at. Such could pass with me
To smooth with eye and accent,indicate
To smooth with eye and accent. Howe supposed ...
To smoother issues, some abysmal cracks
To so much love as makes the form of love
To soften, had herself a sort of heart,
To some ‘yes in you, and walks over you
To some colossal statue of a man:
To some one friend. We must have mediators
To souls, that they assemble on earths flats
To sound so clear through all! I was not well;
To spare such pungent scents as kill with joy.
To speak and claim their portion ... by no means
To speak my poems in mysterious tune
To speak of her to Lady Waldemars
To speak, beloved....
To speculate so largely. None of us
To spend their goodness on her, which she took
To spill gunpowder on ground safe from fire?
To spoil my hands with working in the stream
To spoil the dinner of all tenderer folk
To spoil the drink a little, and lose itself,
To spring up, not be brought forth from the ground,
To stand alone, yet strong enough to bear
To stand and work in. Only two hours since,
To stand by calmly, knowing what I knew,
To stand stock-still like fakirs, till the moss
To stand there by itself, but waiting till
To startle me in the blackness. Still, up, up!
To starve into a blind ferocity
To step into his sunshine of free thought
To stock your English schools for fifty years;
To stop good dreams. Meanwhile I murmured on,
To stumble over and vex you ... ‘curse that stool!
To such a kind of praise, a worthless end
To such an end, was virtue, I supposed,
To such fine meanings, and, like deaf men, loth
To such,and lilies are still lilies, pulled
To suck the stream for ages and get green,
To suffer torment for anothers ease.
To suit a poet;pshaw!
To suit light readers,something in the lines
To suit my stature. I may love my art.
To suit our ways of thought and reverence,
To sweep your ample skirts of womanhood;
To swim the Trenton, rather than true love
To take advantage of it. Yet, tis hard
To take between his dainty, milk-fed lips,
To take me into service as a wife,
To take possession of a senseless world
To take so mere an aftermath from life,
To take the letter? well thenyou and I,
To take them clearest. Verily I was wrong;
To talk about her as already dead,
To teach the living. None of all these things,
To tend my boy, until he cease to need
To the air it came from. Oh, I justified
To the blue luminous tremor of the air,
To the bottom of his dimples,to the ends
To the critic.
To the empty grave of Christ. The worlds hard pressed;
To the height of his opinions. Choose a wife
To the individual man with lips and eyes
To the level of the footlights. Dies no more
To the open road.
To the other half, ... the worse? What are our souls,
To the precipices. Not my headlong leaps
To the very height of hers,‘a word from him?
To the very man for whom she claims to die,
To the waist, or nearly, with the audacious press
To these,and why say more if they condemn,
To think of me, and fix where I shall go?
To think of me, perverse, who went my way,
To think the very love they lavished so,
To think what goes on in his recreant world
To think,I have a pattern on my nail,
To this Olympus.
To this or that convention; ‘exit here
To this world, undisparaged, undespoiled,
To those I suffered. It was afterward
To those innumerous spirits who sun themselves
To throne such feet as yours, my prophetess,
To throw them in the fire. Now, get to bed,
To thrust his own way, he an alien, through
To touch her hand if worthy, and hold her hand
To touch such goodness with a grimy palm.
To touch thy thousand years of gloom:
To trace the involutions, valve by valve,
To travel inland, that I cannot hear
To treat as equals!tis anarchical!
To trick him with apparent sympathies,
To trip the foot up at the first free step!
To try just Gods. Humilitys so good,
To twit you with your race, corrupt your blood,
To undo it, though we should undo ourselves;
To unnatural vampire-uses. See the earth,
To use ... to use! O Romney, O my love,
To vex my darling when hes asked his name
To view the writhing creature,then at last;
To wail in when she had come. No place for her,
To wail like unweaned babes and suck our thumbs
To wait until he chose to lift his hand.
To walk another way than his, dear aunt.
To walk the third with Romney and his friend
To wander on my mountains of Delight,
To wander through the Market-place of Flowers
To wear for ever for her gracious sake;
To wed you, cousin Romney. Take this word,
To weep a little for hes getting old
To weep with this man, that I dared to speak?
To weights and measures, grudging you the power
To what disastrous ends;the storys true.
To what, except for you, had been my heaven,
To where the body sits, and learn
To which a lady sent her to learn books
To which chance made him unexpected heir,
To which he cuts his cedarn poems, fine
To which his business called himself, and left
To which I add,Let no one till his death
To which I answered, ‘Would she hear my task,
To which my father went. All new, and strange
To which we are blind: and then, the nightingales,
To whom a conscience never wakes;
To whom life creeps back in the form of death,
To whom reverts my pittance when I die,
To whoso does not seek it.
To wipe their feet clean on the mountain-turf.
To wisest ladies. Do you think Ill miss
To wonder by my marriage, like poor Leigh?
To work with God at love. And, since God willed
To work with him for ever, and be his wife.
To work with one hand for the booksellers,
To work your universal. It takes a soul,
To you means, such a child, or such a man,
To you, Aurora. Yes, a fine young man

too
Too absolute and earnest, with them all
Too absolute for nature, logical
Too bad I hid a boot
Too bitterly, I said, ‘for the literal truth.
Too close: I could not hear the angels lift
Too common! Never morning wore
Too dangerously on the other side,
Too deeply sunk in craterous sunsets now
Too far for any touch, yet near enough
Too far off for the tuneand yet its fine
Too far! ay, praising our quick sense of love,
Too frequently heavens saints. But me, your work
Too haughty was she to accept a gift
Too hot to hoot
Too human. Have we business, in our rank,
Too intimately. Always Romney Leigh
Too light a book for a grave mans reading! Go,
Too little, when loves May oergrows the ground,
Too long beside a fountain. Yet, behold,
Too much for me, then! turning the face round
Too much here, not to know whats best for peace;
Too much, when that luxuriant wealth of green
Too often sow their wild oats in tame verse,
Too passionate perhaps ... ground up with sobs
Too plainly in the book of my misdeeds;
Too pretty to dispute, and too absurd.
Too proudly,and God snatched the circumstance
Too quickly for distinguishing ... and pushed
Too soon,where, black and stiff, stood up the trees
Too stiffly in former moulds.
Too used to syllable damnations round
Too vaguely apprehended, though indeed

unless
Unless He had given the life, too, with the law.
Unless I had come here, in my settled mind,
Unless I make room for you in my grave
Unless she walked his way of righteousness:
Unless some golden tripod from the sea
Unless some other Christ ... say Romney Leigh ...
Unless some winning special flattery should
Unless the artist keep up open roads
Unless the generous lady, ware of this,
Unless we piece it with anothers life,
Unless we strain it.
Unless you find it in the letter here,

until
Until at last he said, ‘We shall not part.
Until at last, as one, whose heart being sad
Until he marvelled at the soul in mice
Until he took it for a game, and stretched
Until her magic crystal round itself
Until I know about the girl thats lost,
Until I shrieked a shriek I could not hear,
Until I thank your friendship more for that,
Until it gleamed like St. Sophias dome
Until it seemed no more that holy heaven
Until it turned and rent me! Young you were,
Until mankind makes witness, ‘These be men
Until she lose a vantage in her step.
Until she only need to touch his sleeve
Until the angels, on the luminous side
Until the days out and the labour done;
Until the free blood fluttered at her heart,
Until the heart breaks under it ... I love,
Until the moon, diminished to a curve,
Until the oracular shriek shall ooze in froth!
Until the peopled streets being all dismissed,
Until the unborn snatch it, crying out
Until this happened. God knows best, we say,
Until were filled up to the throat with clay,
Until you know not if to flinch from him

Up higher, and ponder how it answers, when
Up still at ten: scarce time to change ones shoes.
Up there, as would a flock of browsing goats.

upon
Upon a gracious public, full of nerves
Upon her church-ring. If she talks of law,
Upon her, like a sudden waterfall,
Upon her,all those buzzing pallid lips
Upon his marriage-contract,not to gain
Upon his mothers knees, where, years ago,
Upon his own head in strong martyrdom,
Upon his way there, walking, for his health,
Upon its own charred funeral-brands put out
Upon my cousins life, to indicate
Upon my mothers picture, ah, poor child!
Upon that womans finger....
Upon the ‘Womans question. Then, for him,
Upon the angular cheek-bones, kerchief torn,
Upon the axe which kills them. When alls done
Upon the burning lava of a song,
Upon the churches with mild open doors
Upon the couch beside me,couch and chair
Upon the dusky pavement, knelt and prayed
Upon the first page. Many a letter signed
Upon the hall-step of her country-house
Upon the hurrying river. Such an air
Upon the loveless many. Work in pairs,
Upon the luminous round of lamp and hearth
Upon the puckered visage of a player;
Upon the self-same pages: Theophrast
Upon the slippery stones set here and there
Upon the social question; heaped reports
Upon the table-book of autographs,
Upon the thought of perfect noon. And when
Upon the threshold of the mind?
Upon the torso of the Drunken Fawn,
Upon the velvet of those baldaquins
Upon the worlds cold cheek to make it burn
Upon their blue wings such red embers round,
Upon their slippery darkness, recollect,
Upon this moon-bathed promontory of earth,
Upon this sleeping child,mans violence,
Upon whose finger, exquisitely pricked

Was ware the baffled changes backward rang,
Was act and joy enough for any bird.
Was always odd; its in the blood, I think;
Was as the whisper of an air
Was bidden to meet St. James in cloth of gold,
Was born upon the ledge of Malvern Hill
Was cased with lingots of ripe Indian corn
Was certainly abolished.
Was civil to her cousin, Romney Leigh,
Was coming through the vines to touch his hand;
Was coming with her bridesmaids presently,
Was commonplace to Lady Guenever;
Was drown'd in passing thro' the ford,
Was easy with me, less for kindness than
Was fatal. Romney,will you leave me here?
Was flooded with a passion unaware,
Was found enfolded in the poor dead hand:
Was ground and tortured by the incessant sea
Was hung before our faces as the badge
Was just the best for him, and me, and her ...
Was light enough to make my heart ache too:
Was looking for the worms, I for the gods.
Was Marian Erle. She was not white nor brown,
Was not built up, as walls are, brick by brick;
Was nothing to be done with such a child,
Was out of place, and, like the silly kid,
Was past ... but that, of course, he never guessed,
Was ready to complete my sum of death.
Was reason. Oh, I did not push the case
Was Romneys terrible calm face above
Was running in her feet and killing the ground;
Was scarce my business. Let them order it;
Was set to wed me, to espouse my class,
Was shut in weak convulsion, womans ill,
Was small to take it in: an acorn-cup
Was something after all, the pastoral saints
Was sooner spoken twixt a pair of friends
Was stealing on us. Genoa broke with day;
Was still a thief. And if a woman steals
Was such her pleasure? ... Then I sate and teased
Was taken at Klagenfurt,because she liked
Was tendered ... when? accepted ... when? I asked.
Was that his face I saw?... his ... Romney Leighs ...
Was there for answering. ‘Romney, she began,
Was this my fathers England? the great isle?
Was trod in haste beside us, and my aunt,
Was wrong against the social code,forced wrong.
Was, was ... you understand meand for him,

we
We all must read, you see, before we live:
We all turn stiller than we have ever been.
We are apt to sit tired, patient as a fool,
We are not harmless?... and that both our harms
We are not slaves to nature. Some of us
We are not so vile. No, nohe cleaves, I think,
We are sepulchred alive in this close world,
We are used to dip our artist-hands in gall
We are wrong always, when we think too much
We beat the phorminx till we hurt our thumbs,
We both had mothers,lay in their bosom once.
We both were wrong that June-day,both as wrong
We buy in England even, clear standing-room
We call the Muse.... ‘O Muse, benignant Muse!
We call those, faces? mens and womens ... ay,
We came so close, we saw our differences
We cannot be the equal of the male,
We cannot, with our admirations even,
We could laugh there, too! Why, Ulysses dog
We count her poorer. Tare with wheat, we cry,
We cover up our face from doing good,
We covet for the soul, the bodys part,
We cry, ‘Weep rather, Dante. Poems are
We dare to shrink back from her warts and blains,
We dare to speak such things, and name such names,
We dared to set up any claim to such!
We do it in our measure. Then I knelt,
We do not make our places with our strains,
We do: well wear no mask, as if we blushed.
We drop the golden cup at Herés foot
We fail,what, then? Aurora, if I smiled
We fair fine ladies, who park out our lives
We feel tis Gods, not ours, and pass it on
We feel it quicken in the dark sometimes;
We get confused, and wonder for our skin
We get no Christ from you,and verily
We get our powers and our effects that way.
We gloriously forget ourselves, and plunge
We had a strange and melancholy walk:
We had burnt our viols and were silent.
We had never wept to think of the little mole
We had not loved nor hated: wherefore dread
We haggle for the small change of our gold,
We have but faith: we cannot know;
We have got instead,that poor lost day, you said
We have too much light here, not to want more fire
We heard a baby sucking in its sleep
We know not if the forests move or we.
We lay down pipes and found a Company
We lived among the mountains many years,
We miss it most when we aspire, ... and fail.
We miss the abstract, when we comprehend!
We mock thee when we do not fear:
We modest women but Ive done my best.
We mused on with conjectural fantasy,
We needs must hunger,better, for mans love,
We never come to.
We never, never, never join hands so.
We only, never call him fatherless
We paced, until, just coming into sight
We parted so. I held him in respect.
We pay it also if we hold our peace,
We plant the graveyards with them.
We play a weary game of hide-and-seek!
We play at leap-frog over the god Term;
We poets always have uneasy hearts;
We pray no longer for our daily bread,
We prophets, poets,Virtues in the word!
We read, or talked, or quarrelled, as it chanced:
We recollect, the roses were too red,
We rose up in a silence almost hard,
We run for, till we lose sight of the sun
We save the people from your saving, here,
We saw above there just a moment back,
We saw not, when we moved therein?
We say ‘my God sometimes, upon our knees,
We say the French are light, as if we said
We say the same of Shakspeares. Ill be meek,
We scarce distinguish. So, with other power.
We seldom doubt that something in the large
We sew, sew, prick our fingers, dull our sight,
We shall not bear above a round or two
We shall not find a sweeter signory
We shall not get a poet, in my mind.
We shape a figure of our fantasy,
We should be ashamed to sit beneath those stars,
We show the sort of monster Romney is,
We stopped beside a house too high and slim
We strain our natures at doing something great,
We surely made too small a part for God
We sweep about for ever in argument;
We take a work on us which is not mans;
We talked on fast, while every common word
We talked. She told me all her story out,
We think, here, you have written a good book,
We tore up papers where our signatures
We tremble and are afraid, and feel as if
We trip upont,alas! and hurt ourselves;
We two are happy. Does he push me off?
We two may live on toward the truer life.
We two, who are not poets, when to wed
We waited. It was early: there was time
We want no half-gods, Panomphæan Joves,
We want the Best in art now, or no art.
We were not lovers, nor even friends well-matched
We will not, when she sneezes, look at her,
We wind out from us the distracting world,
We women are too apt to look to one,
We women should remember what we are,
We wretches cannot tell out all our wrong,
We wronged him after all in what we feared
We, staggering neath our burden as mere men,
Wed change the aggregate and yet retain
Well breathe as softly as the infant here,
Well call her name Aurora Leigh, although
Well call it perjury; I give her up.
Well call them vices festering to despairs,
Well die for you, perhaps,tis probable;
Well dig this Paris to its catacombs
Well guess as much, too, for the universe.
Well have a grove of oaks upon that slope
Well have no tricks played off by gentlefolks;
Well have our whole just stature,five feet four,
Well have the girl, the girl! Your ladies there
Well hope his next laugh may be merrier,
Well keep our aims sublime, our eyes erect,
Well liken to a brutalised King Lear,
Well muse for comfort that, last century,
Well plant a better fortune in its place.
Well plant more yews if possible, albeit
Well say instead, the inconsequent creature, man,
Well say, the unfledged life in the other room,
Well say, then, you were noble in it all,
Well see her righted.
Well shut up the persiani, and sit down,
Well soak up all the slush and soil of life
Well take another answer ... no, or yes.
Well take it graver. Give me sofa-room,
Well take, say, that most perfect of antiques,
Well trust the heavens with something.
Were all born princessomething startled me,
Were all gone wrong. The tune in us is lost:
Were all so,made sotis our womans trade
Were hungry.
Were lazy. This I write against myself.
Were lost so! Shakspeares ghost could scarcely plead
Were made so,not such tyrants to ourselves,
Were mortal.‘We remind them of it.‘Hark,
Were no less selfish. If we sleep on rocks
Were parting! Ah, my snowdrop, what a touch,
Were parting. Certainly, not once or twice,
Were parting. Dearest, men have burnt my house,
Were too materialistic,eating clay,
Weve called the higher life, still must feel the soul
Weve need to talk there.‘She? Tis Lady Ayr,

Well, well! no matter. I but say so much,
Well, well! they say were envious, we who rhyme;
Well, well, no matter! there was dubious need;
Well, well,I saw her then, and must have seen

Went boiling, bubbling up, from all its doors
Went greatening round you in the still blue air,
Went ill with her; and household quiet work,
Went ill, as he related, certainly
Went mad upon them ... madder and more mad,
Went murmuring to him, what, if written here,
Went on behind her; but she weeded out
Went out at early morning, when the air
Went outward, in the face of their surprise,
Went sheathed in brass, and clashed on even heights
Went trickling through the shrubberies in a stream

Were chiefly God by living out Himself
Were dreaming out a summer afternoon
Were ever on me, stinging through my dreams,
Were fiery points on which my words were caught,
Were full of crinkling silks that swept about
Were God and heaven reversed to her: the more
Were green, the carpet was pure green, the straight
Were half as white!but, if it were, perhaps
Were hot and scarlet as the first live rose
Were I she,on Gods brazen altar-bars
Were laid in jasper-stone as clear as glass
Were lost, excepting for the ruby-clasp!
Were magnified before us in the pure
Were models to the universe. And last
Were not too proud, to make good saints in heaven;
Were set upon a high stool at a desk,
Were sooner caught, I think, by One in heaven,
Were sovereign for a peoples leprosy,
Were suddenly silent, while you counted five!
Were surelier mortal: we tore greedily up
Were those the eyes that watched me, worried me?
Were thrown you out of heaven at intervals,
Were torn by horses, women of the court
Were turned in observation. O my God,
Were twice as wretched as you represent,
Were, after all, unequally fatigued!

what
What a face, what a look, what a likeness! Full on mine
What all this weeping scarce will let me say,
What bosky gardens, dropped in close-walled courts,
What business had the baby to cry there?
What can you do with people when they are dead,
What could such lovely ladies have to do
What delicate discernment ... almost thought!
What everlasting love is!how, that night,
What face is that?
What fire i the frost? There must be some response,
What first of all she should have put to proof,
What followed, was told after by Lord Howe,
What form is best for poems? Let me think
What God was, what he wanted from us all,
What grace! what facile turns! what fluent sweeps!
What griping death within the drowning death
What have you in your souls against me then,
What have you, any of you, to say to that,
What he said,
What height we know not,but the way we know,
'What is it makes me beat so low?'
What loss was coming on me, I had done
What matter for the number of the leaves,
What matter to me that the lines are false,
What may or may not pass? I cried. ‘He knows
What men call noble, and you, issued from
What miles of streets that run on after trees,
What navigable river joins itself
What perfect counterpart would be in sight,
What seem'd my worth since I began;
What sort of woman could be suitable
What statues, poised upon their columns fine,
What stops his marriage, and destroys his peace,
What that word means. Forgive, be tolerant;
What then?hes mad, our Hamlet! clap his play,
What then?the heavens are deaf upon that side.
What then?this Cæsar represents, not reigns,
What then?why then, we come home to be sad.
What time he dropped the wallet of the flesh
What time my angel of the Ideal stretched
What ugly monster would take up the end,
What vexes, after all,
What we think never. He is ours, the child;
What whispers from thy lying lip?
What women may, were somewhat limited,
What words are these have falle'n from me?
What, Marian, beaten and sold, who could not die!
What, therefore, if I crown myself to-day
Whats done, at last?
Whats element from whats convention, hastes
Whats left behind; all triumph, something crushed
Whats this, Aurora Leigh,
Whats worthy of him; the choice remains with him;
Whats wrong? The black crowd, as an overstrained

when
When tis the essence of passion to ignore
When all his setting trouble was resolved
When all the faithful troop to morning prayer:
When all went otherwise. She did not speak,
When alls plain dirt,they come back to it at last;
When alls said,yes, but after the seven years;
When alls said. Let him pass. Im not too much
When any other man is sure to speak.
When any young wayfaring soul goes forth
When April comes to let you! Ive been told
When cast in spasms out by the shuddering womb,
When certainly I was so miserable ...
When childhood might pair equally with birds;
When Christian doctrine was enforced at church.
When crucified head downwards.
When death removed this motherstops the mirth
When death shall paralyse these fingers? Pray,
When each by turns was guide to each,
When Egypts slain, I say, let Miriam sing!
When fill'd with tears that cannot fall,
When first I felt my pulses set themselves
When first she chanced on my philanthropy.
When first you told me ... oh, I recollect
When God helps all the workers for his world,
When good Lord Howe expounds his theories
When he and you fought many a field of gold
When he tried in vain
When Im at worst for praise and faggots.
When Joves hand meets us with composing touch,
When June is over! truths not yours, indeed,
When last we read it with a loving friend,
When least convinced pronounce for once aright:
When leave was given her to untie her cloak
When Lucy Gresham, the sick sempstress girl,
When Lucy thanked her sometimes, called her kind,
When Marian was at letters; she would laugh
When men are liberal. For myself, you err
When men catch hold upon my shuddering nerves
When mighty Love would cleave in twain
When more and more the people throng
When mothers fail us, can we help ourselves?
When no ones conscious? who shall say, or guess?
When not called in,as if, with leave to speak,
When not too deep, and even of answering
When observation is not sympathy,
When once gone from us! We may call against
When once relieved of Moses; for youre light,
When one life has been found enough for pain!
When ones too weary! Were a witness by,
When prides impossible. Mark us, how we make
When Romney Leigh and I had parted thus,
When Romney told me that,for now and then
When scarcely I was four years old; my life,
When scheming for the worlds necessities.
When Science reaches forth her arms
When some chromatic sequence of fine thought
When some one came and spoke, or did not come:
When something floats up suddenly, out there,
When speaking on their level, to their like.
When such a stanza, level to their mood,
When Susan drew the curtains, ignorant
When the sense returned,
When they two had their meeting after death.
When things shall have their names. Look long enough
When things went smoothly as a baby drugged,
When trees are happy,and a breath avails
When walking in the town and carry it
When wandering beyond sight. And as I grew
When wanting tickets for the birthnight-ball.
When was it? bring your dates.
When weary, or at morning when afraid,
When wondered at for smiling; not so far,
When you and I talked, you were somewhat right
When you and I, upon my birthday once,
When, drunk and mad with elemental wines,
When, graduating up in a spiral line
When, in the roof fell, and the fire, that paused,
When, watching at his bedside fourteen days,
When?... where? My duty troubles you with words.

Where ledger-strokes and sword-strokes count indeed,
Where lies the master newly dead;
Where many a palace-front peers gloomily
Where Marian Erle, the babe upon her arm,
Where men have stoned me? Have I not the right
Where men sleep better. So, adieu.I fold
Where nothings talked of, save the blight again,
Where some poor bird, escaping from hawks beak,
Where still I heard her in an upper room,
Where the Babe sucked; or, Lamia in her first
Where thou wouldst not. He spoke to Peter thus,
Where, three months since, her eyes were! nay, in fact,

which
Which ... hush!... he has leave to answer in his turn;
Which also she must forfeit for my sake,
Which always had the brown pathetic look
Which angels were too weak to roll away.
Which back they give at cross-time on a sponge,
Which being so,
Which burns and hurts not,not a single bloom,
Which came in heavy with Australian gold?
Which certainly for me it never was
Which come too seldom. Was it you who said
Which could not beat so in the verse without
Which could not find her though you wrote it clear,
Which could not out-smell heaven, or sweeten earth.
Which did not suit their season. The rose fell
Which dims our hedges even, in your eyes,
Which dipped upon the wall. Behind the elms,
Which does not awe you with its claws and beak,
Which drive our burley brutal English mobs
Which drop and powder all the myrtle-groves
Which drowned me with a blush as foolish. ‘You,
Which ended, yet: my brain cleared presently,
Which even Marians low precipitous ‘hush
Which ever since is loose upon the latch
Which every birds too wise for. How I heard
Which falls at midnight, when the tightened bark
Which feeds them to a flame that lasts the night.
Which fence out licence in securing love
Which filled the chamber with its July burst
Which flapped and shivered down our aching eyes
Which gives you, with a random smutch or two,
Which God permits because the questions hard
Which grin at progress in an epigram.
Which grows within a child, makes the child grow,
Which has no smack of it, I pour it out;
Which he, the man here, never doubted. What
Which heaves but with the heaving deep.
Which hedges time in from the eternities,
Which helps a man to live as well as talk,
Which helps this present; I accept for her
Which here, in this chill north, is apt to stand
Which hold at nothing. Can I write to him
Which hurt me in my course. The midnight oil
Which Ill re-tell with fuller utterance,
Which in me grew and heightened into love.
Which is most reverent, with another thought
Which is, I do not love you, Romney Leigh,
Which isnt her fault. Ah, to watch her face,
Which led ... whereer it led ... away, at least;
Which led by tracts that pleased us well,
Which left fire running in my veins, for blood:
Which left me your inferior. Would I were
Which let upon you such disabling news
Which lightened from the firewood, made alive
Which little cared for fades not yet.
Which look as if the May-flower had caught life
Which looked too heavy to be lifted so,
Which love is. Art is much, but love is more.
Which made him over-soft to a lower class,
Which make the sum of ‘I hereafter, when
Which make you laugh that any one should weep
Which makes a mystery of them how at all
Which makes him different from a common man.
Which may bethen indeed, for such a man
Which means life in life! cognisant of life
Which means still less ... than Vincent Carrington ...
Which means that woman-serpent. Is it time
Which means the absolute scorn. ‘Oh, excellent!
Which means whatever perfect thing she can,
Which means, ‘Youll seeyoull see! Ill soon take flight
Which means, not forced to think of being poor
Which meant less than ‘I love you ... than by all
Which meant no more than dying. Do you think
Which meant the best ... a woman and a rose, ...
Which men give women when they judge a book
Which men give women.
Which mine, what mattered? It is so in youth.
Which misbecomes his mother. For the rest,
Which moved me in secret, as the sap is moved
Which Nature placed between the thought and act,
Which never yet had beat, that it should die;
Which nicked me on the forehead as I passed
Which no one scrupled we should feel in full.
Which now he counts so vile, that all the towns
Which obscene text, we may discern perhaps
Which once she foster'd up with care;
Which once were. And concluding, which is clear,
Which oozed off from it in meandering lace
Which pierced Christs heart, has cleft the world in twain
Which plainly held me. So with all the house.
Which pluck our heart across a garden-wall,
Which proves a certain impotence in art.
Which ran,‘Aurora, sweet Chaldean, you read
Which Romney Leigh may clasp as just a friends,
Which rulst for evermore both day and night!
Which ruled, and would not spare, not even herself,
Which scarcely was imperative, grave betimes,
Which seemed to droop on that side and on this,
Which seemed to have come on purpose from the woods
Which seemed to have no part in it, nor power
Which seems to bellow bravely like ten bulls,
Which seems too beauteous to endure itself
Which set the grand still front of Themis son
Which shot up straight against the parting line
Which should be all his, an eye-glance from his face,
Which should be builded out of heaven, to God.
Which should be, staring as about to leap
Which signed the way to Florence. Beautiful
Which slew the tragic poet.
Which slowly burns a widening circle out
Which smack of them from henceforth. Is it right,
Which snaps with a secret spring. Get work, get work;
Which so he had bought and paid for: every thought
Which so, that she might clutch with both her hands,
Which some are: he takes up imperfectly
Which some ones stumbling foot has spurned aside,
Which still at any stirring of the heart
Which still from female finger-tips burns blue,
Which still is life.
Which still must be developed from its one,
Which still presents that mysterys counterpart.
Which stood that moment like brute Druid gods
Which stopped the grounds and dammed the overflow
Which strained their yielding curves out clear and clean
Which strikes out from you, how, you cannot tell,
Which strikes the hours of the eternities,
Which sunrise fills as full as crystal cups
Which suppliants catch at. Then the bitter sea
Which swept from room to room,we fell at once
Which taxed you with this visit, madam.
Which things are corals to cut life upon,
Which threw me on death at intervals,through all
Which thus presents, and thus records true life.
Which took the cheese and left the snare? The same
Which tossed a sudden horror like a sponge
Which tumbled on a sudden into her lap
Which unweaned babies smile at in their sleep
Which vexed me to resistance. Set down this
Which was not Romneys! though she little knew
Which way is the wind to-night? south-east? due east?
Which weep a loss for ever new,
Which weep the comrade of my choice,
Which well the Greeks knew, when they stirred the bark
Which went out therefore. She was weak and frail;
Which went too quick, we all know. Marian Erle!
Which when youve read, youll do it for his boot,
Which will not leave off singing. Up in heaven
Which will not let it quail for having given,
Which would not seem too plain; you go round twice
Which, after sweeping broadly round the house,
Which, closing on a finger into sleep,
Which, fully recognised, would change the world
Which, good to lie beside a bishops chair,
Which, having rained itself to a tardy peace,
Which, if you sit down still, nor sigh too loud,
Which, not being mine, I give you back.Refuse
Which, quivering through the intestine blackness, splits,
Which, round the new-made creatures hanging there,
Which, treading down Gods corn, you trod in sight
Which, whether caught by blossoming tree or bare,

While a philosopher will pass for such,
While all the aisles, alive and black with heads,
While all the dead keep whispering through the withes,
While Art
While every roadside Christ upon his cross
While he marked judgment, I, redemption-day;
While he stares after! Now, the wonder seems
While he, Prince Hamlet, weds a pretty maid
While he, thrown back upon the noble shame
While I ... it seemed no sun had shone on me,
While I am from the west, dear. Read me now
While I go ever toward the wilderness,
While I hear nothing of it through the trees?
While I in vain touch cymbals. Yet, concede,
While I live self-despised for being myself,
While I said nothing. Is there aught to say?
While I shall set myself to read his eyes,
While I stood dumb as Griseld, for black babes
While I, ... I built up follies like a wall
While I, upon the sofa, heard it all.
While I, with shut eyes, smile and motion for
While Jesus loved him.
While Marian, in the garden down below,
While meditating on the last ‘Discourse;
While only her heart ached. ‘Go next week, thought she,
While others gird us with the violent bands
While others ... there he paused,then hoarse, abrupt,
While reckoning up his harvests. So with us;
While rhymes from lovely poems span around
While saints applaud him. He mistook the world:
While still the cue-owls from the cypresses
While still with silken elegiac thoughts
While the dogs bark, and many a shepherd scoffs,
While these blotched souls are eager to infect,
While they respect your practical partial good
While thinking nothing of your personal gain.
While tragic voices that clanged keen as swords,
While we respond with our miasmal fog,
While we sit loveless! is it hard, you think?
While we stood there dumb,
While we two sate together, leaned that night
While we two speak,however may protest
While we, self-awed, drew troubled breath, oppressed
While we, we are shocked at natures falling off,
While women, even the worst, your like, will draw
While working with the other for myself
While you have that face. ‘In church, my lord! fie, fie!
While you! Write far worse than Aurora Leigh,
While, breaking into voluble ecstacy,
While, down their straining sides, streamed manifest
While, far above, a jut of table-land,
While, obviously, this stringent soul itself
While, standing humbly squeezed against the wall,
While, through the waggons coverture and chinks,

who
Who agonise together, rich and poor,
Who all are happy, and sit safe and high,
Who all shall work too. Let our own be calm:
Who also has lost something and is lost,
Who am not as bold, I own those infant eyes
Who answers nothing, save with her brown eyes,
Who are still my light,farewell! How late it is:
Who are wooed in silk among their learned books;
Who bites the kids through too much zeal.
Who bore me senseless from the strangling crowd
Who brews your ale, exceeds in vital worth
Who broke our fair companionship,
Who builds us such a royal book as this
Who burns his viol will not dance, I know,
Who called the Lady Waldemar my wife.
Who cannot couple again or multiply:
Who cannot sleep or eat before he hears,
Who changest not in any gale,
Who chooses Marian for his honoured wife.
Who cometh down at last to reap the earth.
Who counts himself so needful to success.
Who crowned her?it sufficed that she was crowned.
Who else should care? I threw myself aside,
Who ever disappears except a ghost?
Who fail at the beginning to hold and move
Who fain would cleave, his latest will, they say,
Who feels himself at night too far from home,
Who fight against the mothers ‘tiring hand,
Who fits the funerals up, Heaven speed you, sir,
Who fled and screeched.
Who floats in cream, as rich as any sucked
Who gave commission to that fatal weight,
Who go absurdly wrong. The living boor
Who had burnt the viol.
Who had looked at me most gently now and then,
Who had missed her sorely,and one, querulous ...
Who had reached to freedom, not to action, lived,
Who had the heart fort? what reproach touched him?
Who had tied himself to marry ... me, instead
Who has climbed a mountain-height and carried up
Who has felt the desert sting him through his dreams.
Who has God and his mother. O my babe,
Who has the devil in her and theres room
Who has wheeled on her own pivot half a life
Who have had to do with pity more than love.
Who have thought or dreamed, declared and testified,
Who have waited long and travelled far for that,
Who heaps his single platter with goats cheese
Who holds her dear fan while she feeds her smile
Who is not therefore vexed: so bear with it ...
Who judges prophets, and can tell true seers
Who judges, by the attempted, whats attained,
Who keeps his birthdays with a tenants dance,
Who keeps it in a drawer and looks at it
Who keeps the keys of all the creeds,
Who keeps us too long waiting, well confess
Who knits her brows across her pretty eyes
Who knows, I thought, but He may stretch his hand
Who knows? a poet hankers for romance,
Who knows?... and make me laugh again for scorn.
Who laughs in heaven perhaps, that such as I
Who lay the pillow straight: it is not much,
Who leans to mark her shadow on the wall
Who 'lights and rings the gateway bell,
Who looks out from the marble silently
Who love my art, would never wish it lower
Who loves but one, and so gives all at once,
Who loves me? Dearest father,mother sweet,
Who made the suna puzzled blush, that grew,
Who makes the head, content to miss the point,
Who makes the point, agreed to leave the join:
Who might limp surely, if he did not dance,
Who might to-morrow morning be your wife
Who much need helping since the Austrian boar
Who mused on all I had to tell,
Who once had lived full five months in my house,
Who once has loved you as I loved you once,
Who only smile at night beneath the gas:
Who paint for pastime, in their favourite dream,
Who paints a tree, a leaf, a common stone,
Who plant their flowers in our philosophy
Who pledgest now thy gallant son;
Who restless with the summer-heat and play
Who rights a lands finances, is excused
Who rules his blood a little.
Who said at last ... ‘Youre lazy in that house!
Who says theres nothing for the poor and vile
Who scarcely darest to inquire,
Who scorn to touch it with a finger-tip:
Who see that miracle of stars. Behold.
Who seek to touch my lip or clasp my palm,
Who sees a woman as the complement
Who sets her darling down to cut his teeth
Who sewed by Marians chair so still and quick,
Who shall be.
Who shrieked in fits at the Eumenides.
Who sits between the sepulchres and stews,
Who sleeps, she said, ‘and, having drawn this way,
Who soon shall rise in wrath and shake it clear,
Who speak their feeling as it is,
Who stands upon the sea and earth, and swears
Who stares unseen against our absent eyes,
Who think to lay it out new like a park,
Who thinks of asking if the sun is light,
Who thought to take the world upon my back
Who threw you down, that morning you were born,
Who told me Lady Waldemar told her
Who travelled higher than he was born to live,
Who try to take a wife up in the way
Who visits his tame pigeon in the eaves?
Who wonders, when her blood has stood so long
Who would not let men call their wives their own
Who write not ill,remains a man, poor wretch,
Who wrote from college with the same goosequill,
Who yet would count adulteries on her beads
Who, after a dry life-time spent at home
Who, baffled in his love, dares live his life,
Who, being dead, love always. But for me
Who, bursting through the separating hedge
Who, falling on it headlong, dog on dog
Who, having fallen through overloads, stands up
Who, having put the body off, perceive
Who, in a rush of too long prisoned flame,
Who, torn and crushed, are not undone from love.
Whod drive away our Christian gentlefolks,
Wholl never call his own, so true a heart,
Wholl write us richer and completer books.
Whos sorry for a gnat ... or girl?
Whos strongest, He who makes, or he who mars?

Why else do these things move him, leaf or stone?
Why if he had waked, he might have waked, for me.
Why if you had seen her upon Thursday night,
Why not a woman? When weve played in vain
Why not the last? asked he of Göttingen,
Why not? He overblows an ugly grave
Why now, indeed, they sleep.
Why that seemed hard.
Why thats so far from virtue, only vice
Why then, besides five hundred nobodies,
Why what a pettish, petty thing I grow,
Why, after all, I thank you, Aurora Leigh,
Why, call it scant; affect no compromise;
Why, girls with hair and eyes, are everywhere
Why, how one weeps
Why, Marian Erle, youre not the fool to cry?
Why, sir, we cant have even our coffee good,
Why, thats Gods miracle you must not tax,
Why, there he is on a sudden, playing pipes
Why, this room stifles. Better burn than choke;

will
Will bear him still toward insect, beast, and bird,
Will choose his postures when he comes to die,
Will crack even, as the new wine gurgles in.
Will flatter you and take you for a stone,
Will follow at the lighting of their eyes,
Will get fair answers, if the work and love,
Will get to wear it as a hat aside
Will help to make him merry in his love:
Will hold you three hours after by the smell,
Will kill no poor small creature of the wilds
Will leave my handful in my nieces hand
Will mind you of him, as a shoe-string may,
Will never catch it.
Will never land on Ararat, he knows,
Will pass out through the sweetness of a song
Will put all right, and stroke his temples cool
Will scarce see lower than their dainty feet:
Will scarcely damn thee deeper.
Will scarcely seem more dreadful, even to you;
Will see the whole sex in his mistress hood,
Will set you weeping; but a million sick ...
Will sing at dawn,and yet we do not take
Will sometimes only hear the first word, love,
Will split a mans tongue,straight he speaks and says,
Will stick to his good smooth noble life like burrs,
Will take the waters, shivering with the fear
Will tender sayings make men look so white?
Will thrill, indeed, in carrying the young blood.
Will walk as well as you, she cried in haste,
Will wipe a row of single city-lamps
Will write my story for my better self,
Will write of factories and of slaves, as if

with
With ‘sketches, ‘summaries, and ‘last tracts but twelve,
With a childs wonder when you ask him first
With a flower stuck int. Father, then, and child,
With a glance
With a heritage of many corn-fields: nay,
With a quick flame of emotion,‘You have read
With a sense of separation, a blind pain
With a sort of melancholy impatient scorn,
With a special revelation, shakes the heart
With a torch, into the blackness of some cave,
With a trick of ritournelle: the same thing goes
With absolute forefinger, brown and ringed,
With Agamemnon and the goat-nursed gods
With all her ships behind her, and beyond,
With all his face and eyes. ‘No other help?
With all his murderers! Give another name,
With all its brown abandonment of curls
With all its ends,and not the outside life,
With all its grand orchestral silences
With all my phalansterians safely out,
With all my talk I can but set you where
With all the music in her tone,
With all the wild-beast roar of struggling life,
With all their Tuscan pleasures, worn and spoiled,
With all those houseless wretches in the dark,
With all your confluent storms. Then let me grow
With an intense, strong, struggling heart beside
With an old brass button, in a blot of sun,
With any extreme republican. Ah, ah,
With babble of gods. For us, we are called to mark
With back against the window, to exclude
With bat-wings of her vices. Stole my child,
With birds and gnats and large white butterflies
With bitter patience, ‘the child takes his chance,
With bleaching cares of half a million men
With blind hysteric passion, staggering forth
With blood i the veins? I will have henceforth none;
With blood trained up along nine centuries
With blossoming causes,not so far away,
With Branches. Ass or angel, tis the same:
With broidered hems of perfumed handkerchiefs;
With burning stertorous breath that hurt her cheek,
With business and a cousin, he resumed,
With Cæsars image, lightly. I resumed.
With cankerous heart and flesh,which took your best
With chubby children hanging on my neck
With civilisation, having caught the plague
With clogging incrustations. Close to heaven,
With close-pressed bosoms of subsiding nymphs,
With crooked ploughs of actual life,let in
With curses in her eyes and ears and throat,
With decent grace, weve not yet done at all:
With duty, and was strong, for recompense,
With eager utterance,‘you translate me ill.
With eighty thousand women in one smile,
With equal scorn of triangles and wine,
With eucharistic meanings; for he loved.
With everybodys morals.
With eyes immortal, to the antetype
With eyes that, large or small, have won his soul.
With eyes too happy, a familiar thing
With faces toward your jungle. There were three;
With facts and dates. My aunt inherited
With farms and villas.
With fellow-murmurs from their feet and fans,
With fierce contortions of the natural face;
With finding roots for nettles? tis soft clay
With fire,‘though somewhat less so than I seem,
With fixed unflickering outline of dead heat,
With flame, that it should eat and end itself
With formal universals. As if man
With gifts of blue grapes from the hothouses,
With God so near me, could I sing of God?
With Gods Dead, who afford to walk in white
With god-like virtues and heroic aims
With gradual conscience to a perfect night,
With grand horizons by the land or sea,
With grave assurance. ‘Well, you think me bold!
With half-words, delicate reserves, the thing
With harlots, or with even a better name
With healthful, providential interchange;
With healthy touches....
With heart to strike a radiant colour up
With hers, as softly as a strange white bird
With hideous interfusion: youd suppose
With him who stinks since Friday! There it is,
With him who stinks since Friday.
With his voice like a thunder ... ‘This is soul,
With human meanings; else they miss the thought,
With hurrying splendours.
With influent odours? When my joy and pain,
With innings for them all!... what then, indeed,
With innocent distraction, still perhaps
With instant passage to the colonies
With intellectual light, half brutalised
With irrepressive instinct. Thus, at three,
With issimo and ino and sweet poise
With June-days, hand in hand: but once, for all,
With just a fingers tremulous white flame,
With just his hand, and finds it suddenly
With just that shade of sneering on the lip,
With just their comfort. Common words, perhaps;
With Kate ... I think so. Vincent Carrington.
With kindness, with a tolerant gentleness,
With large-eyed horror. ‘Does God make, she said,
With left or right handin the alien sun
With less complacence.
With literal transcript,the worse done, I think,
With low carnivorous laugh,‘A flower, of course!
With man and nature,with the lava-lymph
With meeker spirits than were rife in Rome.
With men, it drops to foolish curd, too sour
With mended morals, quotha,fine new lives!
With Mister Leigh, who am Lady Waldemar,
With morning wakes the will, and cries,
With most despairing wonder in it‘What,
With multitudinous life, and finally
With mutual arms entwined about their necks
With my gown in the dew, took will and way
With my lost Arthur's loved remains,
With native air and tongue. My graves are calm,
With necessary, not inhuman haste,
With news of the committee which sate last
With no one to break up her crystal thoughts;
With one stone-stair, symbolic of my life,
With other children. Well, she laughed sometimes
With other ladies whom her starry lead
With other resolutions. How it weighs,
With out-door impudence? you almost grow?
With passionate desire, to leap and plunge,
With people round me, nor can sleep to-night
With perished generations and their sins:
With piteous open beak that hurt my heart,
With poring over the long sum of ill;
With pressing int my Florence iris-bell,
With pretty ‘may it please you, or ‘so it is,
With pretty maiden seals,initials twined
With pretty troubled faces.
With quiet indignation I broke in.
With quite a different body than St. Paul
With red seals from the table, saying each,
With redder, fuller rounds: and somewhat large
With reverent pity, as, in touching grief,
With rhythms of many suns and moons, in vain
With rosy children hanging on their gowns,
With sense of power and ache,with imposthumes
With servants, broaches, all the flowers I liked,
With shuddering involutions, swaying slow
With sidelong head, and startled, braving eye,
With silver curtains drawn on tinkling rings!
With slam of doors and clash of bells.I sprang,
With smells of oleanders in her hair,
With smile distorted by the sun,face, voice,
With smirks of simmering godship,I washed in
With so much earnest! what effete results,
With softened voices, ere we come to you.
With some one called my wife ... and live, myself?
With somewhat bitter gusts from where you live
With somewhat even writing. Did I think
With splashes of fierce colour. Or I saw
With spray of silver. Thus my Italy
With springs delicious trouble in the ground
With still that face ... which did not therefore change,
With strange electric life; and both my cheeks
With such a dawn of conscience. For the heart,
With such a filthy secret.
With such a needy heart on two pale lips,
With such a pungent soul-dart, even the Queen
With such a sigh as drops from agony
With such a total of distracted life, ...
With such a voice! Well, voice and look were now
With such prodigious eyes in such small heads!
With sudden anger, and approaching me
With sweet half-listenings for each others breath,
With talking of the winds! perhaps as much
With that cold Leigh look which I fancied once,
With that he vanished. I could hear his heel
With that last sun-ray, crying, ‘give me, give,
With that pathetic vacillating roll
With that snow near it. Not that Romney Leigh
With that, she left me in the garden-walk.
With that, they parted. She kept sight of Heaven,
With the bridegroom.
With the eyes in it, start between the boughs
With the great out-goings of ecstatic souls,
With the human hearts large seasons,when it hopes
With the marriage-breakfast; praying in white gloves,
With the new order. As it was, indeed,
With the old man there, in those ill-odorous rags,
With the passion of my hands. Ah, Romney laughed
With the toil of the ascent, takes breath at last,
With these light women of a thrifty vice,
With this or that quack nostrum,recipes
With those too fiery and impatient souls,
With those unclean white hands of hers. Enough.
With three-piled carpets, to receive your foot
With thrills of time upon it. Not indeed
With times we live in,evermore too great
With touches of the out-door country-news
With tuneful laughs the silver-fretted rocks,
With two pale faces. Was it death or life
With us, I say, though Im of Italy
With various others of his socialists;
With vehement lips across a gap of air
With violets which blossom in the spring.
With vocal pines and waters,out of books
With voices broken by the human sob,
With wandering neighings. In between the gaps
With what a Devils daughter I went forth
With what contents God: I must analyse,
With what cracked pitchers go we to deep wells
With what despondent and surprised reproach!
With winter from the hills, may throw i the lap
With winters and with autumns,and beyond,
With wishes, thinking, `here to-day,'
With womans passion clung about her waist,
With womanly compassion and reserve
With women of my class, tis otherwise:
With wonderful low voices and soft steps,
With yelling hound-jaws,his indignant words,
With you, Aurora!though you sweep your sex
With your reputation. I have known good wives,
With youths ideal: and when people came

Within her green hopes pretty garden-ground;
Within my wayside hedge, and pass your way!
Within St. Margarets Court I stood alone,
Within the gardens, what a heap of babes,
Within the green the moulder'd tree,
Within this round of sequestration white

without
Without a bond fort, as a lover should,
Without a flower upon the spiritual side,
Without a poets individualism
Without considering whether they were fit
Without convulsions. In another month
Without farewell,just breaking with a jerk
Without him: so I hate you from this gulf
Without his presence!Places are too much
Without offence to decent happy folk.
Without some ultimate aim: ah, ah, I see,
Without such glancing at the looking-glass
Without the accents. Read it? Not a word.
Without the approbation of a man?
Without the natural shame which creatures feel
Without the pang. I marvel, people choose
Without the poets individualism
Without this Romney: I can see it at last;
Without your cousin,and you still maintain
Without your help indeed, unless you take

would
Would breathing thro' his lips impart
Would choose his poor lost Marian, like me best,
Would cover Samminiato, church and all,
Would dare adopt such fancy-forgeries
Would dote and pore on yonder cloud
Would draggle his smooth time. But I, whose days
Would fain be a Christian still, for all his wit;
Would fasten me for ever in his sight,
Would fetch enough to buy me shoes, to go
Would find some keyhole toward the secresy
Would God sit quiet, let us think, in heaven,
Would look down suddenly and say, ‘Herein
Would lose no moment of the blessed time.
Would no sound come? or is the music mine,
Would scare the writer if they splashed the mud
Would seem not much, yet fetched him better help
Would seem to tingle in me now and then,
Would serve seven years to call me wife, I know:
Would shake the house, my lintel being uncrossed
Would show less hardness. But Im dead, you see,
Would shudder along the purple-veined wrist
Would stink sometimes; there came some vulgar needs:
Would stop and ask her how her eyes outgrew
Would suffer steadily and never flinch,
Would take the sea in sooner.
Would tap me softly with her slender foot,
Would watch me from his sun-patch on the floor,

yet
Yet Art walks forward, and knows where to walk:
Yet as that other, wandering there
Yet breaking, I felt conscious, from a smile,
Yet competent to love, like him?
Yet dared seem soft.
Yet each so follow a vocation,his
Yet gracious and conciliating, it takes
Yet had no time to learn to talk and walk
Yet have such daughters?
Yet He can pluck us from that shameful cross.
Yet indeed,
Yet Marian thought he did not take it ill,
Yet measure to yourself a prophets place
Yet most of all Im angry with myself
Yet rich enough to sympathise with thought?
Yet Romney leaves me....
Yet she, tis certain, is my very wife;
Yet so as by fire! we make a pretty show
Yet spread His glory, than keep quiet here,
Yet still it will not make her ... if shes dead,
Yet the outcast child,
Yet, so, I will not.This vile womans way

you
You ... I ... a score of such weak workers, ... He
You ... speaking, breathing, living, side by side
You all put up your finger‘See the thief!
You are very safe from Marian and myself:
You artist women, of the common sex;
You bid a hungry child be satisfied
You blushed so ... nay, forgive me; do not stir:
You break the mythic turf where danced the nymphs,
You call it pity,think Im generous?
You can, I think. At least, as touches me,
You cannot eat or drink or stand or sit,
You cannot kiss but you shall bring away
You cannot, from a suitor disallowed,
You care to ask? Well, girls have curious minds,
You care to keep in memory: and I hold
You catch a sight of Nature, earliest,
You choose to bring them, as I choose perhaps
You clap hands‘A fair day!you cheer him on,
You could as soon weep for the rule of three,
You could not catch it if the days were thick,
You could not peel a fruit you fear to bruise
You could not push your head out and escape
You dared the risk of finding the said Muse?
You dig about its roots and water it,
You do not count enough a noble heart,
You do not love, that you should surely know
You double up your lip? Ah, that indeed
You ever after have been graver. He,
You fancy, might unroof him suddenly,
You feel as conquerors though you did not fight,
You feel Im not the woman of the world
You find, at best, a park. A nature tamed
You found it‘....
You give us doating mothers, and chaste wives,
You had one like that? There, Marian breaking off
You had to tell me of the friend ... the friend?
You have a wife already whom you love,
You have not heard of her ...? quite out of sight,
You heard the news from Vincent Carrington.
You hinted that, but jested. Well, at least,
You know Lord Howe, who sees him ... whom he sees,
You know the sort of woman,brilliant stuff,
You labour for your own bread painfully,
You lie upon the bed at nights and weep.
You look down coldly on the arena-heaps
You love this man. I have watched you when he came,
You lovers of the beautiful and whole,
You might feel interest, though youre locked of course
You missed a point, I think, through lack of love.
You must not overlook the poets work
You must not pump spring-water unawares
You need entreat her now to let it go:
You need not wish me joy to think of it,
You need the lower life to stand upon,
You never can be satisfied with praise
You once detected, turned against the wall,
You owe her, cousin Romney, no amends;
You paint a soul by implication, like
You piece of pity!
You pitiful corruption! At the thought,
You play beside a death-bed like a child,
You please me, Romney, when you please yourself;
You poets are benighted in this age;
You pulled as low as Tophet to the top
You said an hour, and stay three hours, I think,
You saw one morning waiting in the cold,
You saw she champed against it.
You scarcely found the poet of Vaucluse
You scarcely had been sadder as my wife?
You see her; sitting close to Romney Leigh;
You see me. Pardon, that I set a trap
You see me?
You see us too much in your heavenly light;
You seldom catch these birds, except with chaff:
You seldom understood me,but, before,
You shake your head my cousin; I guess ill.
You shall not hang her up, but dig a hole
You shall not hinder. He, as shaking out
You shall not interrupt me: as you said,
You shall not need to put a shutter up
You shall not praise me so against your heart,
You shall not vex him, ... jar him when hes sad,
You share not with us, and exceed us so
You showed me something separate from yourself,
You sink no more than Moses bulrush-boat,
You smile at last, then.
You sold that poisonous porridge called your soul
You spared me, in your turn, to like me much.
You spoke a name, Aurora.
You stand so less than woman, through being more,
You swore this very social rose smelt ill.
You take a kid you like, and turn it out
You take a mule to climb, and not a muse,
You take this Marian, such as wicked men
You think a woman ripens as a peach,In
You think me really wicked?
You think the bee makes honey half a year,
You think the heartache would sound decenter,
You think your dear Vandykes would give them pause?
You think, and its a reasonable thought,
You think, perhaps, I am not changed from pride,
You throw a window open, and lean out
You took a liking to the wretched girl.
You took it for a venturous piece of spite,
You tremble. Tender-hearted! Do you mind
You understand the letter ... ere the fall,
You understand?no, do not look at me,
You want a helpmate, not a mistress, sir,
You wear your blue so chiefly in your eyes,
You wear your sackcloth looped in Cæsars way,
You weep for what you know. A red-haired child
You who keep account
You who weep easily grow pale to see
You will not find that famous deed of gift,
You will not tell him, though were innocent
You wish to die and leave the world a-dusk
You wish to lead me to my cousins betrothed,
You womanto impute such ill to me?
You wonder what can keep it in its place
You would not leave a foot-print.
You would not scruple to accept from me
You would not stand and let a good mans dog
You write as well ... and ill ... upon the whole,
You write so of the poets, and not laugh?
You yield your wife, protection, freedom, ease,
You, Marian, and I, Romney?
You, you, Lord Howe?in things indifferent, well.
You,joining in a protest gainst the wrong
you.
Youd call Miss Norris modest.‘You again!
Youd come upon a great charred circle where
Youd meet them and not wink perhaps, nor fear
Youd soon attain to a trick of looking up,
Youd think they really heard,and so they do ...
Youll be to-morrow. What, we pick our way,
Youll catch Antinous somewhere in that clay,
Youll find a story on another leaf
Youll find another reader the next time.
Youll find no cause, in all your scruples, why
Youll find some fairer angel at his back,
Youll give the bond your signature, perhaps,
Youll grant that even a woman may love art,
Youll have no pipers after: Romney will
Youll have the younger in the Elders chair,
Youll learn to say it in a cheerful voice.
Youll make a work-day of your holiday,
Youll seek him vainly in the bulrushes,
Youll set me down as wrong in many things.
Youll sound your ‘me more proudlytill I shrink.
Youll suffer me to walk with you beyond
Youll trust me, cousin, as a gentleman,
Youll want some comfort. So I leave you Smith;
Youll write and say she shall not miss your love
Youre at the difficult point, the join. Tis true
Youre dull as any London afternoon.
Youre free from me, Aurora!
Youre granted very sorely pitiable!
Youre great and pure; but were you purer still,
Youre light, my cousin! which is well for you,
Youre nothing to him. Pay the income-tax,
Youre poor, except in what you richly give;
Youre richer than you fancy. The will says,
Youre right about Lord Howe! Lord Howes a trump;
Youre Romneys friend. Whats all this waiting for?
Youre slow in England. In a month I learnt
Youre standing, madam, on my second flounce
Youre treading on my shawlI thank you, sir.
Youve been as silent as a poet should,
Youve been my friend: you will not now be his?
Youve gnats instead, love!loves fool-paradise
Youve helped the facile youth to live youths day
Youve known him, that hes worthy of a friend;
Youve made a happy marriage for your friend;
Youve planted a thick flowering evergreen,
Youve played your part, my Lady Waldemar,
Youve praised me, sir, for truth,and now youll learn
Youve read your Leighs. Indeed twould shake a house,
Youve seen Prince Alberts model lodging-house?
Youve wronged me foully. Are you made so ill,

Your ancient neighbours? The great book-club teems
Your audience, I may get their leave perhaps
Your aunt should cavil at a deed of gift
Your autograph upon a tinted leaf
Your book, Aurora, for an hour, that day:
Your brothers daughter has dismissed me here;
Your cause is noble, your ends excellent,
Your children work for you, not you for them,
Your cousin Romney Leighs a monster! there,
Your cousin to the house, and have your talk,
Your cousin!ah, most like you! Ere you came
Your dreamland, right of common, and green rest.
Your droop of eyelid is the same as his,
Your eggs to-morrow at breakfast, in the pause
Your face! thats worse.
Your father and your mother?
Your father were a negro, and your son
Your favourable thoughts. Were fallen on days,
Your friendship, friend,if that convicted She
Your gelid sweetness on my palm but so,
Your happy pastorals of the meads and trees,
Your heart a-flutter over the snow-hills;
Your houses hospitalities. Farewell.
Your intermittent rushlight of the past
Your ladyship has left me curious why
Your largesse without thinking any more
Your last book folded in her dimpled hands,
Your last book lies at the phalanstery,
Your Leigh by heart: he has sown his black young curls
Your letters, poor Aurora! for they stare
Your lightest footfall on a floor of mine
Your liking surely had done worse for me
Your most ungracious letter, and confess,
Your mother must have been a pretty thing,
Your own determined, calm, indifferent way
Your plans in going hence, and where you go.
Your right in choosing.
Your scaling ladders of high logicmount
Your scorn is better, cousin Romney. I
Your scruples just as if I thought them wise
Your social theory. Bless you both, I say.
Your steps, for ever buzzing in the room,
Your task this morning?have you read that book?
Your tears spoil Lady Waldemars new dress,
Your verses are less good than I suppose.
Your very own pine-cones, in a grand disdain
Your words,I could say other words of yours;
