introduction
robbie
runaround
reason
introduction
i
looked
at
my
notes
and
i
didn’t
like
them
i’d
spent
three
days
at
u
s
robots
and
might
as
well
have
spent
them
at
home
with
the
encyclopedia
tellurica
susan
calvin
had
been
born
in
the
year
1982
they
said
which
made
her
seventy-five
now
everyone
knew
that
appropriately
enough
u
s
robot
and
mechanical
men
inc
was
seventy-five
also
since
it
had
been
in
the
year
of
dr
calvin’s
birth
that
lawrence
robertson
had
first
taken
out
incorporation
papers
for
what
eventually
became
the
strangest
industrial
giant
in
man’s
history
well
everyone
knew
that
too
at
the
age
of
twenty
susan
calvin
had
been
part
of
the
particular
psycho-math
seminar
at
which
dr
alfred
lanning
of
u
s
robots
had
demonstrated
the
first
mobile
robot
to
be
equipped
with
a
voice
it
was
a
large
clumsy
unbeautiful
robot
smelling
of
machine-oil
and
destined
for
the
projected
mines
on
mercury
but
it
could
speak
and
make
sense
susan
said
nothing
at
that
seminar
took
no
part
in
the
hectic
discussion
period
that
followed
she
was
a
frosty
girl
plain
and
colorless
who
protected
herself
against
a
world
she
disliked
by
a
mask-like
expression
and
a
hypertrophy
of
intellect
but
as
she
watched
and
listened
she
felt
the
stirrings
of
a
cold
enthusiasm
she
obtained
her
bachelor’s
degree
at
columbia
in
2003
and
began
graduate
work
in
cybernetics
all
that
had
been
done
in
the
mid-twentieth
century
on
calculating
machines
had
been
upset
by
robertson
and
his
positronic
brain-paths
the
miles
of
relays
and
photocells
had
given
way
to
the
spongy
globe
of
plantinumiridium
about
the
size
of
a
human
brain
she
learned
to
calculate
the
parameters
necessary
to
fix
the
possible
variables
within
the
positronic
brain
to
construct
brains
on
paper
such
that
the
responses
to
given
stimuli
could
be
accurately
predicted
in
2008
she
obtained
her
ph.d
and
joined
united
states
robots
as
a
robopsychologist
becoming
the
first
great
practitioner
of
a
new
science
lawrence
robertson
was
still
president
of
the
corporation
alfred
lanning
had
become
director
of
research
for
fifty
years
she
watched
the
direction
of
human
progress
change
and
leap
ahead
now
she
was
retiring

as
much
as
she
ever
could
at
least
she
was
allowing
someone
else’s
name
to
be
inset
upon
the
door
of
her
office
that
essentially
was
what
i
had
i
had
a
long
list
of
her
published
papers
of
the
patents
in
her
name
i
had
the
chronological
details
of
her
promotions
in
short
i
had
her
professional
vita
in
full
detail
but
that
wasn’t
what
i
wanted
i
needed
more
than
that
for
my
feature
articles
for
interplanetary
press
much
more
i
told
her
so
dr
calvin
i
said
as
lushly
as
possible
in
the
mind
of
the
public
you
and
u
s
robots
are
identical
your
retirement
will
end
an
era
and
you
want
the
human-interest
angle
she
didn’t
smile
at
me
i
don’t
think
she
ever
smiles
but
her
eyes
were
sharp
though
not
angry
i
felt
her
glance
slide
through
me
and
out
my
occiput
and
knew
that
i
was
uncommonly
transparent
to
her
that
everybody
was
but
i
said
that’s
right
human
interest
out
of
robots
a
contradiction
no
doctor
out
of
you
well
i’ve
been
called
a
robot
myself
surely
they’ve
told
you
i’m
not
human
they
had
but
there
was
no
point
in
saying
so
she
got
up
from
her
chair
she
wasn’t
tall
and
she
looked
frail
i
followed
her
to
the
window
and
we
looked
out
the
offices
and
factories
of
u
s
robots
were
a
small
city
spaced
and
planned
it
was
flattened
out
like
an
aerial
photograph
when
i
first
came
here
she
said
i
had
a
little
room
in
a
building
right
about
there
where
the
fire-house
is
now
she
pointed
it
was
torn
down
before
you
were
born
i
shared
the
room
with
three
others
i
had
half
a
desk
we
built
our
robots
all
in
one
building
output

three
a
week
now
look
at
us
fifty
years
i
hackneyed
is
a
long
time
not
when
you’re
looking
back
at
them
she
said
you
wonder
how
they
vanished
so
quickly
she
went
back
to
her
desk
and
sat
down
she
didn’t
need
expression
on
her
face
to
look
sad
somehow
how
old
are
you
she
wanted
to
know
thirty-two
i
said
then
you
don’t
remember
a
world
without
robots
there
was
a
time
when
humanity
faced
the
universe
alone
and
without
a
friend
now
he
has
creatures
to
help
him
stronger
creatures
than
himself
more
faithful
more
useful
and
absolutely
devoted
to
him
mankind
is
no
longer
alone
have
you
ever
thought
of
it
that
way
i’m
afraid
i
haven’t
may
i
quote
you
you
may
to
you
a
robot
is
a
robot
gears
and
metal
electricity
and
positrons
mind
and
iron
human-made
if
necessary
human-destroyed
but
you
haven’t
worked
with
them
so
you
don’t
know
them
they’re
a
cleaner
better
breed
than
we
are
i
tried
to
nudge
her
gently
with
words
we’d
like
to
hear
some
of
the
things
you
could
tell
us
get
your
views
on
robots
the
interplanetary
press
reaches
the
entire
solar
system
potential
audience
is
three
billion
dr
calvin
they
ought
to
know
what
you
could
tell
them
on
robots
it
wasn’t
necessary
to
nudge
she
didn’t
hear
me
but
she
was
moving
in
the
right
direction
they
might
have
known
that
from
the
start
we
sold
robots
for
earth-use
then

before
my
time
it
was
even
of
course
that
was
when
robots
could
not
talk
afterward
they
became
more
human
and
opposition
began
the
labor
unions
of
course
naturally
opposed
robot
competition
for
human
jobs
and
various
segments
of
religious
opinion
had
their
superstitious
objections
it
was
all
quite
ridiculous
and
quite
useless
and
yet
there
it
was
i
was
taking
it
down
verbatim
on
my
pocket-recorder
trying
not
to
show
the
knuckle-motions
of
my
hand
if
you
practice
a
bit
you
can
get
to
the
point
where
you
can
record
accurately
without
taking
the
little
gadget
out
of
your
pocket
take
the
case
of
robbie
she
said
i
never
knew
him
he
was
dismantled
the
year
before
i
joined
the
company

hopelessly
out-of-date
but
i
saw
the
little
girl
in
the
museum
she
stopped
but
i
didn’t
say
anything
i
let
her
eyes
mist
up
and
her
mind
travel
back
she
had
lots
of
time
to
cover
i
heard
about
it
later
and
when
they
called
us
blasphemers
and
demon-creators
i
always
thought
of
him
robbie
was
a
non-vocal
robot
he
couldn’t
speak
he
was
made
and
sold
in
1996
those
were
the
days
before
extreme
specialization
so
he
was
sold
as
a
nursemaid
as
a
what
as
a
nursemaid
robbie
ninety-eight

one
hundred
gloria
withdrew
her
chubby
little
forearm
from
before
her
eyes
and
stood
for
a
moment
wrinkling
her
nose
and
blinking
in
the
sunlight
then
trying
to
watch
in
all
directions
at
once
she
withdrew
a
few
cautious
steps
from
the
tree
against
which
she
had
been
leaning
she
craned
her
neck
to
investigate
the
possibilities
of
a
clump
of
bushes
to
the
right
and
then
withdrew
farther
to
obtain
a
better
angle
for
viewing
its
dark
recesses
the
quiet
was
profound
except
for
the
incessant
buzzing
of
insects
and
the
occasional
chirrup
of
some
hardy
bird
braving
the
midday
sun
gloria
pouted
i
bet
he
went
inside
the
house
and
i’ve
told
him
a
million
times
that
that’s
not
fair
with
tiny
lips
pressed
together
tightly
and
a
severe
frown
crinkling
her
forehead
she
moved
determinedly
toward
the
two-story
building
up
past
the
driveway
too
late
she
heard
the
rustling
sound
behind
her
followed
by
the
distinctive
and
rhythmic
clump-clump
of
robbie’s
metal
feet
she
whirled
about
to
see
her
triumphing
companion
emerge
from
hiding
and
make
for
the
home-tree
at
full
speed
gloria
shrieked
in
dismay
wait
robbie
that
wasn’t
fair
robbie
you
promised
you
wouldn’t
run
until
i
found
you
her
little
feet
could
make
no
headway
at
all
against
robbie’s
giant
strides
then
within
ten
feet
of
the
goal
robbie’s
pace
slowed
suddenly
to
the
merest
of
crawls
and
gloria
with
one
final
burst
of
wild
speed
dashed
pantingly
past
him
to
touch
the
welcome
bark
of
home-tree
first
gleefully
she
turned
on
the
faithful
robbie
and
with
the
basest
of
ingratitude
rewarded
him
for
his
sacrifice
by
taunting
him
cruelly
for
a
lack
of
running
ability
robbie
can’t
run
she
shouted
at
the
top
of
her
eight-year-old
voice
i
can
beat
him
any
day
i
can
beat
him
any
day
she
chanted
the
words
in
a
shrill
rhythm
robbie
didn’t
answer
of
course

not
in
words
he
pantomimed
running
instead
inching
away
until
gloria
found
herself
running
after
him
as
he
dodged
her
narrowly
forcing
her
to
veer
in
helpless
circles
little
arms
outstretched
and
fanning
at
the
air
robbie
she
squealed
stand
still

and
the
laughter
was
forced
out
of
her
in
breathless
jerks
until
he
turned
suddenly
and
caught
her
up
whirling
her
round
so
that
for
her
the
world
fell
away
for
a
moment
with
a
blue
emptiness
beneath
and
green
trees
stretching
hungrily
downward
toward
the
void
then
she
was
down
in
the
grass
again
leaning
against
robbie’s
leg
and
still
holding
a
hard
metal
finger
after
a
while
her
breath
returned
she
pushed
uselessly
at
her
disheveled
hair
in
vague
imitation
of
one
of
her
mother’s
gestures
and
twisted
to
see
if
her
dress
were
torn
she
slapped
her
hand
against
robbie’s
torso
bad
boy
i’ll
spank
you
and
robbie
cowered
holding
his
hands
over
his
face
so
that
she
had
to
add
no
i
won’t
robbie
i
won’t
spank
you
but
anyway
it’s
my
turn
to
hide
now
because
you’ve
got
longer
legs
and
you
promised
not
to
run
till
i
found
you
robbie
nodded
his
head

a
small
parallelepiped
with
rounded
edges
and
corners
attached
to
a
similar
but
much
larger
parallelepiped
that
served
as
torso
by
means
of
a
short
flexible
stalk

and
obediently
faced
the
tree
a
thin
metal
film
descended
over
his
glowing
eyes
and
from
within
his
body
came
a
steady
resonant
ticking
don’t
peek
now

and
don’t
skip
any
numbers
warned
gloria
and
scurried
for
cover
with
unvarying
regularity
seconds
were
ticked
off
and
at
the
hundredth
up
went
the
eyelids
and
the
glowing
red
of
robbie’s
eyes
swept
the
prospect
they
rested
for
a
moment
on
a
bit
of
colorful
gingham
that
protruded
from
behind
a
boulder
he
advanced
a
few
steps
and
convinced
himself
that
it
was
gloria
who
squatted
behind
it
slowly
remaining
always
between
gloria
and
home-tree
he
advanced
on
the
hiding
place
and
when
gloria
was
plainly
in
sight
and
could
no
longer
even
theorize
to
herself
that
she
was
not
seen
he
extended
one
arm
toward
her
slapping
the
other
against
his
leg
so
that
it
rang
again
gloria
emerged
sulkily
you
peeked
she
exclaimed
with
gross
unfairness
besides
i’m
tired
of
playing
hide-and-seek
i
want
a
ride
but
robbie
was
hurt
at
the
unjust
accusation
so
he
seated
himself
carefully
and
shook
his
head
ponderously
from
side
to
side
gloria
changed
her
tone
to
one
of
gentle
coaxing
immediately
come
on
robbie
i
didn’t
mean
it
about
the
peeking
give
me
a
ride
robbie
was
not
to
be
won
over
so
easily
though
he
gazed
stubbornly
at
the
sky
and
shook
his
head
even
more
emphatically
please
robbie
please
give
me
a
ride
she
encircled
his
neck
with
rosy
arms
and
hugged
tightly
then
changing
moods
in
a
moment
she
moved
away
if
you
don’t
i’m
going
to
cry
and
her
face
twisted
appallingly
in
preparation
hard-hearted
robbie
paid
scant
attention
to
this
dreadful
possibility
and
shook
his
head
a
third
time
gloria
found
it
necessary
to
play
her
trump
card
if
you
don’t
she
exclaimed
warmly
i
won’t
tell
you
any
more
stories
that’s
all
not
one
robbie
gave
in
immediately
and
unconditionally
before
this
ultimatum
nodding
his
head
vigorously
until
the
metal
of
his
neck
hummed
carefully
he
raised
the
little
girl
and
placed
her
on
his
broad
flat
shoulders
gloria’s
threatened
tears
vanished
immediately
and
she
crowed
with
delight
robbie’s
metal
skin
kept
at
a
constant
temperature
of
seventy
by
the
high
resistance
coils
within
felt
nice
and
comfortable
while
the
beautifully
loud
sound
her
heels
made
as
they
bumped
rhythmically
against
his
chest
was
enchanting
you’re
an
air-coaster
robbie
you’re
a
big
silver
aircoaster
hold
out
your
arms
straight

you
got
to
robbie
if
you’re
going
to
be
an
aircoaster
the
logic
was
irrefutable
robbie’s
arms
were
wings
catching
the
air
currents
and
he
was
a
silver
coaster
gloria
twisted
the
robot’s
head
and
leaned
to
the
right
he
banked
sharply
gloria
equipped
the
coaster
with
a
motor
that
went
br-r-r
and
then
with
weapons
that
went
powie
and
sh-sh
shshsh
pirates
were
giving
chase
and
the
ship’s
blasters
were
coming
into
play
the
pirates
dropped
in
a
steady
rain
got
another
one
two
more
she
cried
then
faster
men
gloria
said
pompously
we’re
running
out
of
ammunition
she
aimed
over
her
shoulder
with
undaunted
courage
and
robbie
was
a
blunt-nosed
spaceship
zooming
through
the
void
at
maximum
acceleration
clear
across
the
field
he
sped
to
the
patch
of
tall
grass
on
the
other
side
where
he
stopped
with
a
suddenness
that
evoked
a
shriek
from
his
flushed
rider
and
then
tumbled
her
onto
the
soft
green
carpet
gloria
gasped
and
panted
and
gave
voice
to
intermittent
whispered
exclamations
of
that
was
nice
robbie
waited
until
she
had
caught
her
breath
and
then
pulled
gently
at
a
lock
of
hair
you
want
something
said
gloria
eyes
wide
in
an
apparently
artless
complexity
that
fooled
her
huge
nursemaid
not
at
all
he
pulled
the
curl
harder
oh
i
know
you
want
a
story
robbie
nodded
rapidly
which
one
robbie
made
a
semi-circle
in
the
air
with
one
finger
the
little
girl
protested
again
i’ve
told
you
cinderella
a
million
times
aren’t
you
tired
of
it

it’s
for
babies
another
semi-circle
oh
well
gloria
composed
herself
ran
over
the
details
of
the
tale
in
her
mind
together
with
her
own
elaborations
of
which
she
had
several
and
began
are
you
ready
well

once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
beautiful
little
girl
whose
name
was
ella
and
she
had
a
terribly
cruel
step-mother
and
two
very
ugly
and
very
cruel
step-sisters
and
gloria
was
reaching
the
very
climax
of
the
tale

midnight
was
striking
and
everything
was
changing
back
to
the
shabby
originals
lickety-split
while
robbie
listened
tensely
with
burning
eyes
when
the
interruption
came
gloria
it
was
the
high-pitched
sound
of
a
woman
who
has
been
calling
not
once
but
several
times
and
had
the
nervous
tone
of
one
in
whom
anxiety
was
beginning
to
overcome
impatience
mamma’s
calling
me
said
gloria
not
quite
happily
you’d
better
carry
me
back
to
the
house
robbie
robbie
obeyed
with
alacrity
for
somehow
there
was
that
in
him
which
judged
it
best
to
obey
mrs
weston
without
as
much
as
a
scrap
of
hesitation
gloria’s
father
was
rarely
home
in
the
daytime
except
on
sunday

today
for
instance

and
when
he
was
he
proved
a
genial
and
understanding
person
gloria’s
mother
however
was
a
source
of
uneasiness
to
robbie
and
there
was
always
the
impulse
to
sneak
away
from
her
sight
mrs
weston
caught
sight
of
them
the
minute
they
rose
above
the
masking
tufts
of
long
grass
and
retired
inside
the
house
to
wait
i’ve
shouted
myself
hoarse
gloria
she
said
severely
where
were
you
i
was
with
robbie
quavered
gloria
i
was
telling
him
cinderella
and
i
forgot
it
was
dinner­time
well
it’s
a
pity
robbie
forgot
too
then
as
if
that
reminded
her
of
the
robot’s
presence
she
whirled
upon
him
you
may
go
robbie
she
doesn’t
need
you
now
then
brutally
and
don’t
come
back
till
i
call
you
robbie
turned
to
go
but
hesitated
as
gloria
cried
out
in
his
defense
wait
mamma
you
got
to
let
him
stay
i
didn’t
finish
cinderella
for
him
i
said
i
would
tell
him
cinderella
and
i’m
not
finished
gloria
honest
and
truly
mamma
he’ll
stay
so
quiet
you
won’t
even
know
he’s
here
he
can
sit
on
the
chair
in
the
corner
and
he
won’t
say
a
word
i
mean
he
won’t
do
anything
will
you
robbie
robbie
appealed
to
nodded
his
massive
head
up
and
down
once
gloria
if
you
don’t
stop
this
at
once
you
shan’t
see
robbie
for
a
whole
week
the
girl’s
eyes
fell
all
right
but
cinderella
is
his
favorite
story
and
i
didn’t
finish
it
and
he
likes
it
so
much
the
robot
left
with
a
disconsolate
step
and
gloria
choked
back
a
sob
george
weston
was
comfortable
it
was
a
habit
of
his
to
be
comfortable
on
sunday
afternoons
a
good
hearty
dinner
below
the
hatches
a
nice
soft
dilapidated
couch
on
which
to
sprawl
a
copy
of
the
times
slippered
feet
and
shirtless
chest
how
could
anyone
help
but
be
comfortable
he
wasn’t
pleased
therefore
when
his
wife
walked
in
after
ten
years
of
married
life
be
still
was
so
unutterably
foolish
as
to
love
her
and
there
was
no
question
that
he
was
always
glad
to
see
her
still
sunday
afternoons
just
after
dinner
were
sacred
to
him
and
his
idea
of
solid
comfort
was
to
be
left
in
utter
solitude
for
two
or
three
hours
consequently
he
fixed
his
eye
firmly
upon
the
latest
reports
of
the
lefebre-yoshida
expedition
to
mars
this
one
was
to
take
off
from
lunar
base
and
might
actually
succeed
and
pretended
she
wasn’t
there
mrs
weston
waited
patiently
for
two
minutes
then
impatiently
for
two
more
and
finally
broke
the
silence
george
hmpph
george
i
say
will
you
put
down
that
paper
and
look
at
me
the
paper
rustled
to
the
floor
and
weston
turned
a
weary
face
toward
his
wife
what
is
it
dear
you
know
what
it
is
george
it’s
gloria
and
that
terrible
machine
what
terrible
machine
now
don’t
pretend
you
don’t
know
what
i’m
talking
about
it’s
that
robot
gloria
calls
robbie
he
doesn’t
leave
her
for
a
moment
well
why
should
he
he’s
not
supposed
to
and
he
certainly
isn’t
a
terrible
machine
he’s
the
best
darn
robot
money
can
buy
and
i’m
damned
sure
he
set
me
back
half
a
year’s
income
he’s
worth
it
though

darn
sight
cleverer
than
half
my
office
staff
he
made
a
move
to
pick
up
the
paper
again
but
his
wife
was
quicker
and
snatched
it
away
you
listen
to
me
george
i
won’t
have
my
daughter
entrusted
to
a
machine

and
i
don’t
care
how
clever
it
is
it
has
no
soul
and
no
one
knows
what
it
may
be
thinking
a
child
just
isn’t
made
to
be
guarded
by
a
thing
of
metal
weston
frowned
when
did
you
decide
this
he’s
been
with
gloria
two
years
now
and
i
haven’t
seen
you
worry
till
now
it
was
different
at
first
it
was
a
novelty
it
took
a
load
off
me
and

and
it
was
a
fashionable
thing
to
do
but
now
i
don’t
know
the
neighbors
well
what
have
the
neighbors
to
do
with
it
now
look
a
robot
is
infinitely
more
to
be
trusted
than
a
human
nursemaid
robbie
was
constructed
for
only
one
purpose
really

to
be
the
companion
of
a
little
child
his
entire
mentality
has
been
created
for
the
purpose
he
just
can’t
help
being
faithful
and
loving
and
kind
he’s
a
machine-made
so
that’s
more
than
you
can
say
for
humans
but
something
might
go
wrong
some
some
mrs
weston
was
a
bit
hazy
about
the
insides
of
a
robot
some
little
jigger
will
come
loose
and
the
awful
thing
will
go
berserk
and
and
she
couldn’t
bring
herself
to
complete
the
quite
obvious
thought
nonsense
weston
denied
with
an
involuntary
nervous
shiver
that’s
completely
ridiculous
we
had
a
long
discussion
at
the
time
we
bought
robbie
about
the
first
law
of
robotics
you
know
that
it
is
impossible
for
a
robot
to
harm
a
human
being
that
long
before
enough
can
go
wrong
to
alter
that
first
law
a
robot
would
be
completely
inoperable
it’s
a
mathematical
impossibility
besides
i
have
an
engineer
from
u
s
robots
here
twice
a
year
to
give
the
poor
gadget
a
complete
overhaul
why
there’s
no
more
chance
of
any
thing
at
all
going
wrong
with
robbie
than
there
is
of
you
or
i
suddenly
going
loony

considerably
less
in
fact
besides
how
are
you
going
to
take
him
away
from
gloria
he
made
another
futile
stab
at
the
paper
and
his
wife
tossed
it
angrily
into
the
next
room
that’s
just
it
george
she
won’t
play
with
anyone
else
there
are
dozens
of
little
boys
and
girls
that
she
should
make
friends
with
but
she
won’t
she
won’t
go
near
them
unless
i
make
her
that’s
no
way
for
a
little
girl
to
grow
up
you
want
her
to
be
normal
don’t
you
you
want
her
to
be
able
to
take
her
part
in
society
you’re
jumping
at
shadows
grace
pretend
robbie’s
a
dog
i’ve
seen
hundreds
of
children
who
would
rather
have
their
dog
than
their
father
a
dog
is
different
george
we
must
get
rid
of
that
horrible
thing
you
can
sell
it
back
to
the
company
i’ve
asked
and
you
can
you’ve
asked
now
look
here
grace
let’s
not
go
off
the
deep
end
we’re
keeping
the
robot
until
gloria
is
older
and
i
don’t
want
the
subject
brought
up
again
and
with
that
he
walked
out
of
the
room
in
a
huff
mrs
weston
met
her
husband
at
the
door
two
evenings
later
you’ll
have
to
listen
to
this
george
there’s
bad
feeling
in
the
village
about
what
asked
weston
he
stepped
into
the
washroom
and
drowned
out
any
possible
answer
by
the
splash
of
water
mrs
weston
waited
she
said
about
robbie
weston
stepped
out
towel
in
hand
face
red
and
angry
what
are
you
talking
about
oh
it’s
been
building
up
and
building
up
i’ve
tried
to
close
my
eyes
to
it
but
i’m
not
going
to
any
more
most
of
the
villagers
consider
robbie
dangerous
children
aren’t
allowed
to
go
near
our
place
in
the
evenings
we
trust
our
child
with
the
thing
well
people
aren’t
reasonable
about
these
things
then
to
hell
with
them
saying
that
doesn’t
solve
the
problem
i’ve
got
to
do
my
shopping
down
there
i’ve
got
to
meet
them
every
day
and
it’s
even
worse
in
the
city
these
days
when
it
comes
to
robots
new
york
has
just
passed
an
ordinance
keeping
all
robots
off
the
streets
between
sunset
and
sunrise
all
right
but
they
can’t
stop
us
from
keeping
a
robot
in
our
home
grace
this
is
one
of
your
campaigns
i
recognize
it
but
it’s
no
use
the
answer
is
still
no
we’re
keeping
robbie
and
yet
he
loved
his
wife

and
what
was
worse
his
wife
knew
it
george
weston
after
all
was
only
a
man

poor
thing

and
his
wife
made
full
use
of
every
device
which
a
clumsier
and
more
scrupulous
sex
has
learned
with
reason
and
futility
to
fear
ten
times
in
the
ensuing
week
he
cried
robbie
stays
and
that’s
final
and
each
time
it
was
weaker
and
accompanied
by
a
louder
and
more
agonized
groan
came
the
day
at
last
when
weston
approached
his
daughter
guiltily
and
suggested
a
beautiful
visivox
show
in
the
village
gloria
clapped
her
hands
happily
can
robbie
go
no
dear
he
said
and
winced
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
they
won’t
allow
robots
at
the
visivox
but
you
can
tell
him
all
about
it
when
you
get
home
he
stumbled
all
over
the
last
few
words
and
looked
away
gloria
came
back
from
town
bubbling
over
with
enthusiasm
for
the
visivox
had
been
a
gorgeous
spectacle
indeed
she
waited
for
her
father
to
maneuver
the
jet-car
into
the
sunken
garage
wait
till
i
tell
robbie
daddy
he
would
have
liked
it
like
anything
especially
when
francis
fran
was
backing
away
so-o-o
quietly
and
backed
right
into
one
of
the
leopard-men
and
had
to
run
she
laughed
again
daddy
are
there
really
leopard-men
on
the
moon
probably
not
said
weston
absently
it’s
just
funny
make-believe
he
couldn’t
take
much
longer
with
the
car
he’d
have
to
face
it
gloria
ran
across
the
lawn
robbie
robbie
then
she
stopped
suddenly
at
the
sight
of
a
beautiful
collie
which
regarded
her
out
of
serious
brown
eyes
as
it
wagged
its
tail
on
the
porch
oh
what
a
nice
dog
gloria
climbed
the
steps
approached
cautiously
and
patted
it
is
it
for
me
daddy
her
mother
had
joined
them
yes
it
is
gloria
isn’t
it
nice

soft
and
furry
it’s
very
gentle
it
likes
little
girls
can
he
play
games
surely
he
can
do
any
number
of
tricks
would
you
like
to
see
some
right
away
i
want
robbie
to
see
him
too
robbie
she
stopped
uncertainly
and
frowned
i’ll
bet
he’s
just
staying
in
his
room
because
he’s
mad
at
me
for
not
taking
him
to
the
visivox
you’ll
have
to
explain
to
him
daddy
he
might
not
believe
me
but
he
knows
if
you
say
it
it’s
so
weston’s
lip
grew
tighter
he
looked
toward
his
wife
but
could
not
catch
her
eye
gloria
turned
precipitously
and
ran
down
the
basement
steps
shouting
as
she
went
robbie
come
and
see
what
daddy
and
mamma
brought
me
they
brought
me
a
dog
robbie
in
a
minute
she
had
returned
a
frightened
little
girl
mamma
robbie
isn’t
in
his
room
where
is
he
there
was
no
answer
and
george
weston
coughed
and
was
suddenly
extremely
interested
in
an
aimlessly
drifting
cloud
gloria’s
voice
quavered
on
the
verge
of
tears
where’s
robbie
mamma
mrs
weston
sat
down
and
drew
her
daughter
gently
to
her
don’t
feel
bad
gloria
robbie
has
gone
away
i
think
gone
away
where
where’s
he
gone
away
mamma
no
one
knows
darling
he
just
walked
away
we’ve
looked
and
we’ve
looked
and
we’ve
looked
for
him
but
we
can’t
find
him
you
mean
he’ll
never
come
back
again
her
eyes
were
round
with
horror
we
may
find
him
soon
we’ll
keep
looking
for
him
and
meanwhile
you
can
play
with
your
nice
new
doggie
look
at
him
his
name
is
lightning
and
he
can
but
gloria’s
eyelids
had
overflown
i
don’t
want
the
nasty
dog

i
want
robbie
i
want
you
to
find
me
robbie
her
feelings
became
too
deep
for
words
and
she
spluttered
into
a
shrill
wail
mrs
weston
glanced
at
her
husband
for
help
but
he
merely
shuffled
his
feet
morosely
and
did
not
withdraw
his
ardent
stare
from
the
heavens
so
she
bent
to
the
task
of
consolation
why
do
you
cry
gloria
robbie
was
only
a
machine
just
a
nasty
old
machine
he
wasn’t
alive
at
all
he
was
not
no
machine
screamed
gloria
fiercely
and
ungrammatically
he
was
a
person
just
like
you
and
me
and
he
was
my
friend
i
want
him
back
oh
mamma
i
want
him
back
her
mother
groaned
in
defeat
and
left
gloria
to
her
sorrow
let
her
have
her
cry
out
she
told
her
husband
childish
griefs
are
never
lasting
in
a
few
days
she’ll
forget
that
awful
robot
ever
existed
but
time
proved
mrs
weston
a
bit
too
optimistic
to
be
sure
gloria
ceased
crying
but
she
ceased
smiling
too
and
the
passing
days
found
her
ever
more
silent
and
shadowy
gradually
her
attitude
of
passive
unhappiness
wore
mrs
weston
down
and
all
that
kept
her
from
yielding
was
the
impossibility
of
admitting
defeat
to
her
husband
then
one
evening
she
flounced
into
the
living
room
sat
down
folded
her
arms
and
looked
boiling
mad
her
husband
stretched
his
neck
in
order
to
see
her
over
his
newspaper
what
now
grace
it’s
that
child
george
i’ve
had
to
send
back
the
dog
today
gloria
positively
couldn’t
stand
the
sight
of
him
she
said
she’s
driving
me
into
a
nervous
breakdown
weston
laid
down
the
paper
and
a
hopeful
gleam
entered
his
eye
maybe
maybe
we
ought
to
get
robbie
back
it
might
be
done
you
know
i
can
get
in
touch
with
no
she
replied
grimly
i
won’t
hear
of
it
we’re
not
giving
up
that
easily
my
child
shall
not
be
brought
up
by
a
robot
if
it
takes
years
to
break
her
of
it
weston
picked
up
his
paper
again
with
a
disappointed
air
a
year
of
this
will
have
me
prematurely
gray
you’re
a
big
help
george
was
the
frigid
answer
what
gloria
needs
is
a
change
of
environment
of
course
she
can’t
forget
robbie
here
how
can
she
when
every
tree
and
rock
reminds
her
of
him
it
is
really
the
silliest
situation
i
have
ever
heard
of
imagine
a
child
pining
away
for
the
loss
of
a
robot
well
stick
to
the
point
what’s
the
change
in
environment
you’re
planning
we’re
going
to
take
her
to
new
york
the
city
in
august
say
do
you
know
what
new
york
is
like
in
august
it’s
unbearable
millions
do
bear
it
they
don’t
have
a
place
like
this
to
go
to
if
they
didn’t
have
to
stay
in
new
york
they
wouldn’t
well
we
have
to
i
say
we’re
leaving
now

or
as
soon
as
we
can
make
the
arrangements
in
the
city
gloria
will
find
sufficient
interests
and
sufficient
friends
to
perk
her
up
and
make
her
forget
that
machine
oh
lord
groaned
the
lesser
half
those
frying
pavements
we
have
to
was
the
unshaken
response
gloria
has
lost
five
pounds
in
the
last
month
and
my
little
girl’s
health
is
more
important
to
me
than
your
comfort
it’s
a
pity
you
didn’t
think
of
your
little
girl’s
health
before
you
deprived
her
of
her
pet
robot
he
muttered

but
to
himself
gloria
displayed
immediate
signs
of
improvement
when
told
of
the
impending
trip
to
the
city
she
spoke
little
of
it
but
when
she
did
it
was
always
with
lively
anticipation
again
she
began
to
smile
and
to
eat
with
something
of
her
former
appetite
mrs
weston
hugged
herself
for
joy
and
lost
no
opportunity
to
triumph
over
her
still
skeptical
husband
you
see
george
she
helps
with
the
packing
like
a
little
angel
and
chatters
away
as
if
she
hadn’t
a
care
in
the
world
it’s
just
as
i
told
you

all
we
need
do
is
substitute
other
interests
hmpph
was
the
skeptical
response
i
hope
so
preliminaries
were
gone
through
quickly
arrangements
were
made
for
the
preparation
of
their
city
home
and
a
couple
were
engaged
as
housekeepers
for
the
country
home
when
the
day
of
the
trip
finally
did
come
gloria
was
all
but
her
old
self
again
and
no
mention
of
robbie
passed
her
lips
at
all
in
high
good-humor
the
family
took
a
taxi-gyro
to
the
airport
weston
would
have
preferred
using
his
own
private
gyro
but
it
was
only
a
two-seater
with
no
room
for
baggage
and
entered
the
waiting
liner
come
gloria
called
mrs
weston
i’ve
saved
you
a
seat
near
the
window
so
you
can
watch
the
scenery
gloria
trotted
down
the
aisle
cheerily
flattened
her
nose
into
a
white
oval
against
the
thick
clear
glass
and
watched
with
an
intentness
that
increased
as
the
sudden
coughing
of
the
motor
drifted
backward
into
the
interior
she
was
too
young
to
be
frightened
when
the
ground
dropped
away
as
if
let
through
a
trap
door
and
she
herself
suddenly
became
twice
her
usual
weight
but
not
too
young
to
be
mightily
interested
it
wasn’t
until
the
ground
had
changed
into
a
tiny
patchwork
quilt
that
she
withdrew
her
nose
and
faced
her
mother
again
will
we
soon
be
in
the
city
mamma
she
asked
rubbing
her
chilled
nose
and
watching
with
interest
as
the
patch
of
moisture
which
her
breath
had
formed
on
the
pane
shrank
slowly
and
vanished
in
about
half
an
hour
dear
then
with
just
the
faintest
trace
of
anxiety
aren’t
you
glad
we’re
going
don’t
you
think
you’ll
be
very
happy
in
the
city
with
all
the
buildings
and
people
and
things
to
see
we’ll
go
to
the
visivox
every
day
and
see
shows
and
go
to
the
circus
and
the
beach
and
yes
mamma
was
gloria’s
unenthusiastic
rejoinder
the
liner
passed
over
a
bank
of
clouds
at
the
moment
and
gloria
was
instantly
absorbed
in
the
usual
spectacle
of
clouds
underneath
one
then
they
were
over
clear
sky
again
and
she
turned
to
her
mother
with
a
sudden
mysterious
air
of
secret
knowledge
i
know
why
we’re
going
to
the
city
mamma
do
you
mrs
weston
was
puzzled
why
dear
you
didn’t
tell
me
because
you
wanted
it
to
be
a
surprise
but
i
know
for
a
moment
she
was
lost
in
admiration
at
her
own
acute
penetration
and
then
she
laughed
gaily
we’re
going
to
new
york
so
we
can
find
robbie
aren’t
we
with
detectives
the
statement
caught
george
weston
in
the
middle
of
a
drink
of
water
with
disastrous
results
there
was
a
sort
of
strangled
gasp
a
geyser
of
water
and
then
a
bout
of
choking
coughs
when
all
was
over
he
stood
there
a
red-faced
water-drenched
and
very
very
annoyed
person
mrs
weston
maintained
her
composure
but
when
gloria
repeated
her
question
in
a
more
anxious
tone
of
voice
she
found
her
temper
rather
bent
maybe
she
retorted
tartly
now
sit
and
be
still
for
heaven’s
sake
new
york
city
1998
a.d
was
a
paradise
for
the
sightseer
more
than
ever
in
its
history
gloria’s
parents
realized
this
and
made
the
most
of
it
on
direct
orders
from
his
wife
george
weston
arranged
to
have
his
business
take
care
of
itself
for
a
month
or
so
in
order
to
be
free
to
spend
the
time
in
what
he
termed
dissipating
gloria
to
the
verge
of
ruin
like
everything
else
weston
did
this
was
gone
about
in
an
efficient
thorough
and
business-like
way
before
the
month
had
passed
nothing
that
could
be
done
had
not
been
done
she
was
taken
to
the
top
of
the
half-mile
tall
roosevelt
building
to
gaze
down
in
awe
upon
the
jagged
panorama
of
rooftops
that
blended
far
off
in
the
fields
of
long
island
and
the
flatlands
of
new
jersey
they
visited
the
zoos
where
gloria
stared
in
delicious
fright
at
the
real
live
lion
rather
disappointed
that
the
keepers
fed
him
raw
steaks
instead
of
human
beings
as
she
had
expected
and
asked
insistently
and
peremptorily
to
see
the
whale
the
various
museums
came
in
for
their
share
of
attention
together
with
the
parks
and
the
beaches
and
the
aquarium
she
was
taken
halfway
up
the
hudson
in
an
excursion
steamer
fitted
out
in
the
archaism
of
the
mad
twenties
she
traveled
into
the
stratosphere
on
an
exhibition
trip
where
the
sky
turned
deep
purple
and
the
stars
came
out
and
the
misty
earth
below
looked
like
a
huge
concave
bowl
down
under
the
waters
of
the
long
island
sound
she
was
taken
in
a
glass-walled
sub-sea
vessel
where
in
a
green
and
wavering
world
quaint
and
curious
sea-things
ogled
her
and
wiggled
suddenly
away
on
a
more
prosaic
level
mrs
weston
took
her
to
the
department
stores
where
she
could
revel
in
another
type
of
fairyland
in
fact
when
the
month
had
nearly
sped
the
westons
were
convinced
that
everything
conceivable
had
been
done
to
take
gloria’s
mind
once
and
for
all
off
the
departed
robbie

but
they
were
not
quite
sure
they
had
succeeded
the
fact
remained
that
wherever
gloria
went
she
displayed
the
most
absorbed
and
concentrated
interest
in
such
robots
as
happened
to
be
present
no
matter
how
exciting
the
spectacle
before
her
nor
how
novel
to
her
girlish
eyes
she
turned
away
instantly
if
the
corner
of
her
eye
caught
a
glimpse
of
metallic
movement
mrs
weston
went
out
of
her
way
to
keep
gloria
away
from
all
robots
and
the
matter
was
finally
climaxed
in
the
episode
at
the
museum
of
science
and
industry
the
museum
had
announced
a
special
children’s
program
in
which
exhibits
of
scientific
witchery
scaled
down
to
the
child
mind
were
to
be
shown
the
westons
of
course
placed
it
upon
their
list
of
absolutely
it
was
while
the
westons
were
standing
totally
absorbed
in
the
exploits
of
a
powerful
electro­magnet
that
mrs
weston
suddenly
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
gloria
was
no
longer
with
her
initial
panic
gave
way
to
calm
decision
and
enlisting
the
aid
of
three
attendants
a
careful
search
was
begun
gloria
of
course
was
not
one
to
wander
aimlessly
however
for
her
age
she
was
an
unusually
determined
and
purposeful
girl
quite
full
of
the
maternal
genes
in
that
respect
she
had
seen
a
huge
sign
on
the
third
floor
which
had
said
this
way
to
the
talking
robot
having
spelled
it
out
to
herself
and
having
noticed
that
her
parents
did
not
seem
to
wish
to
move
in
the
proper
direction
she
did
the
obvious
thing
waiting
for
an
opportune
moment
of
parental
distraction
she
calmly
disengaged
herself
and
followed
the
sign
the
talking
robot
was
a
tour
de
force
a
thoroughly
impractical
device
possessing
publicity
value
only
once
an
hour
an
escorted
group
stood
before
it
and
asked
questions
of
the
robot
engineer
in
charge
in
careful
whispers
those
the
engineer
decided
were
suitable
for
the
robot’s
circuits
were
transmitted
to
the
talking
robot
it
was
rather
dull
it
may
be
nice
to
know
that
the
square
of
fourteen
is
one
hundred
ninety-six
that
the
temperature
at
the
moment
is
72
degrees
fahrenheit
and
the
air-pressure
30.02
inches
of
mercury
that
the
atomic
weight
of
sodium
is
23
but
one
doesn’t
really
need
a
robot
for
that
one
especially
does
not
need
an
unwieldy
totally
immobile
mass
of
wires
and
coils
spreading
over
twenty-five
square
yards
few
people
bothered
to
return
for
a
second
helping
but
one
girl
in
her
middle
teens
sat
quietly
on
a
bench
waiting
for
a
third
she
was
the
only
one
in
the
room
when
gloria
entered
gloria
did
not
look
at
her
to
her
at
the
moment
another
human
being
was
but
an
inconsiderable
item
she
saved
her
attention
for
this
large
thing
with
the
wheels
for
a
moment
she
hesitated
in
dismay
it
didn’t
look
like
any
robot
she
had
ever
seen
cautiously
and
doubtfully
she
raised
her
treble
voice
please
mr
robot
sir
are
you
the
talking
robot
sir
she
wasn’t
sure
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
a
robot
that
actually
talked
was
worth
a
great
deal
of
politeness
the
girl
in
her
mid-teens
allowed
a
look
of
intense
concentration
to
cross
her
thin
plain
face
she
whipped
out
a
small
notebook
and
began
writing
in
rapid
pothooks
there
was
an
oily
whir
of
gears
and
a
mechanically
timbered
voice
boomed
out
in
words
that
lacked
accent
and
intonation
i
am
the
robot
that
talks
gloria
stared
at
it
ruefully
it
did
talk
but
the
sound
came
from
inside
somewheres
there
was
no
face
to
talk
to
she
said
can
you
help
me
mr
robot
sir
the
talking
robot
was
designed
to
answer
questions
and
only
such
questions
as
it
could
answer
had
ever
been
put
to
it
it
was
quite
confident
of
its
ability
therefore
i
can
help
you
thank
you
mr
robot
sir
have
you
seen
robbie
who
is
robbie
he’s
a
robot
mr
robot
sir
she
stretched
to
tiptoes
he’s
about
so
high
mr
robot
sir
only
higher
and
he’s
very
nice
he’s
got
a
head
you
know
i
mean
you
haven’t
but
he
has
mr
robot
sir
the
talking
robot
had
been
left
behind
a
robot
yes
mr
robot
sir
a
robot
just
like
you
except
he
can’t
talk
of
course
and

looks
like
a
real
person
a
robot
like
me
yes
mr
robot
sir
to
which
the
talking
robot’s
only
response
was
an
erratic
splutter
and
an
occasional
incoherent
sound
the
radical
generalization
offered
it
i.e
its
existence
not
as
a
particular
object
but
as
a
member
of
a
general
group
was
too
much
for
it
loyally
it
tried
to
encompass
the
concept
and
half
a
dozen
coils
burnt
out
little
warning
signals
were
buzzing
the
girl
in
her
mid-teens
left
at
that
point
she
had
enough
for
her
physics-1
paper
on
practical
aspects
of
robotics
this
paper
was
susan
calvin’s
first
of
many
on
the
subject
gloria
stood
waiting
with
carefully
concealed
impatience
for
the
machine’s
answer
when
she
heard
the
cry
behind
her
of
there
she
is
and
recognized
that
cry
as
her
mother’s
what
are
you
doing
here
you
bad
girl
cried
mrs
weston
anxiety
dissolving
at
once
into
anger
do
you
know
you
frightened
your
mamma
and
daddy
almost
to
death
why
did
you
run
away
the
robot
engineer
had
also
dashed
in
tearing
his
hair
and
demanding
who
of
the
gathering
crowd
had
tampered
with
the
machine
can’t
anybody
read
signs
he
yelled
you’re
not
allowed
in
here
without
an
attendant
gloria
raised
her
grieved
voice
over
the
din
i
only
came
to
see
the
talking
robot
mamma
i
thought
he
might
know
where
robbie
was
because
they’re
both
robots
and
then
as
the
thought
of
robbie
was
suddenly
brought
forcefully
home
to
her
she
burst
into
a
sudden
storm
of
tears
and
i
got
to
find
robbie
mamma
i
got
to
mrs
weston
strangled
a
cry
and
said
oh
good
heavens
come
home
george
this
is
more
than
i
can
stand
that
evening
george
weston
left
for
several
hours
and
the
next
morning
he
approached
his
wife
with
something
that
looked
suspiciously
like
smug
complacence
i’ve
got
an
idea
grace
about
what
was
the
gloomy
uninterested
query
about
gloria
you’re
not
going
to
suggest
buying
back
that
robot
no
of
course
not
then
go
ahead
i
might
as
well
listen
to
you
nothing
i’ve
done
seems
to
have
done
any
good
all
right
here’s
what
i’ve
been
thinking
the
whole
trouble
with
gloria
is
that
she
thinks
of
robbie
as
a
person
and
not
as
a
machine
naturally
she
can’t
forget
him
now
if
we
managed
to
convince
her
that
robbie
was
nothing
more
than
a
mess
of
steel
and
copper
in
the
form
of
sheets
and
wires
with
electricity
its
juice
of
life
how
long
would
her
longings
last
it’s
the
psychological
attack
if
you
see
my
point
how
do
you
plan
to
do
it
simple
where
do
you
suppose
i
went
last
night
i
persuaded
robertson
of
u
s
robots
and
mechanical
men
inc
to
arrange
for
a
complete
tour
of
his
premises
tomorrow
the
three
of
us
will
go
and
by
the
time
we’re
through
gloria
will
have
it
drilled
into
her
that
a
robot
is
not
alive
mrs
weston’s
eyes
widened
gradually
and
something
glinted
in
her
eyes
that
was
quite
like
sudden
admiration
why
george
that’s
a
good
idea
and
george
weston’s
vest
buttons
strained
only
kind
i
have
he
said
mr
struthers
was
a
conscientious
general
manager
and
naturally
inclined
to
be
a
bit
talkative
the
combination
therefore
resulted
in
a
tour
that
was
fully
explained
perhaps
even
over-abundantly
explained
at
every
step
however
mrs
weston
was
not
bored
indeed
she
stopped
him
several
times
and
begged
him
to
repeat
his
statements
in
simpler
language
so
that
gloria
might
understand
under
the
influence
of
this
appreciation
of
his
narrative
powers
mr
struthers
expanded
genially
and
became
ever
more
communicative
if
possible
george
weston
himself
showed
a
gathering
impatience
pardon
me
struthers
he
said
breaking
into
the
middle
of
a
lecture
on
the
photoelectric
cell
haven’t
you
a
section
of
the
factory
where
only
robot
labor
is
employed
eh
oh
yes
yes
indeed
he
smiled
at
mrs
weston
a
vicious
circle
in
a
way
robots
creating
more
robots
of
course
we
are
not
making
a
general
practice
out
of
it
for
one
thing
the
unions
would
never
let
us
but
we
can
turn
out
a
very
few
robots
using
robot
labor
exclusively
merely
as
a
sort
of
scientific
experiment
you
see
he
tapped
his
pince-nez
into
one
palm
argumentatively
what
the
labor
unions
don’t
realize

and
i
say
this
as
a
man
who
has
always
been
very
sympathetic
with
the
labor
movement
in
general

is
that
the
advent
of
the
robot
while
involving
some
dislocation
to
begin
with
will
inevitably
yes
struthers
said
weston
but
about
that
section
of
the
factory
you
speak
of

may
we
see
it
it
would
be
very
interesting
i’m
sure
yes
yes
of
course
mr
struthers
replaced
his
pince-nez
in
one
convulsive
movement
and
gave
vent
to
a
soft
cough
of
discomfiture
follow
me
please
he
was
comparatively
quiet
while
leading
the
three
through
a
long
corridor
and
down
a
flight
of
stairs
then
when
they
had
entered
a
large
well-lit
room
that
buzzed
with
metallic
activity
the
sluices
opened
and
the
flood
of
explanation
poured
forth
again
there
you
are
he
said
with
pride
in
his
voice
robots
only
five
men
act
as
overseers
and
they
don’t
even
stay
in
this
room
in
five
years
that
is
since
we
began
this
project
not
a
single
accident
has
occurred
of
course
the
robots
here
assembled
are
comparatively
simple
but
the
general
manager’s
voice
had
long
died
to
a
rather
soothing
murmur
in
gloria’s
ears
the
whole
trip
seemed
rather
dull
and
pointless
to
her
though
there
were
many
robots
in
sight
none
were
even
remotely
like
robbie
though
and
she
surveyed
them
with
open
contempt
in
this
room
there
weren’t
any
people
at
all
she
noticed
then
her
eyes
fell
upon
six
or
seven
robots
busily
engaged
at
a
round
table
halfway
across
the
room
they
widened
in
incredulous
surprise
it
was
a
big
room
she
couldn’t
see
for
sure
but
one
of
the
robots
looked
like

looked
like

it
was
robbie
her
shriek
pierced
the
air
and
one
of
the
robots
about
the
table
faltered
and
dropped
the
tool
he
was
holding
gloria
went
almost
mad
with
joy
squeezing
through
the
railing
before
either
parent
could
stop
her
she
dropped
lightly
to
the
floor
a
few
feet
below
and
ran
toward
her
robbie
arms
waving
and
hair
flying
and
the
three
horrified
adults
as
they
stood
frozen
in
their
tracks
saw
what
the
excited
little
girl
did
not
see

a
huge
lumbering
tractor
bearing
blindly
down
upon
its
appointed
track
it
took
split-seconds
for
weston
to
come
to
his
senses
and
those
split-seconds
meant
everything
for
gloria
could
not
be
overtaken
although
weston
vaulted
the
railing
in
a
wild
attempt
it
was
obviously
hopeless
mr
struthers
signaled
wildly
to
the
overseers
to
stop
the
tractor
but
the
overseers
were
only
human
and
it
took
time
to
act
it
was
only
robbie
that
acted
immediately
and
with
precision
with
metal
legs
eating
up
the
space
between
himself
and
his
little
mistress
he
charged
down
from
the
opposite
direction
everything
then
happened
at
once
with
one
sweep
of
an
arm
robbie
snatched
up
gloria
slackening
his
speed
not
one
iota
and
consequently
knocking
every
breath
of
air
out
of
her
weston
not
quite
comprehending
all
that
was
happening
felt
rather
than
saw
robbie
brush
past
him
and
came
to
a
sudden
bewildered
halt
the
tractor
intersected
gloria’s
path
half
a
second
after
robbie
had
rolled
on
ten
feet
further
and
came
to
a
grinding
long
drawn-out
stop
gloria
regained
her
breath
submitted
to
a
series
of
passionate
hugs
on
the
part
of
both
her
parents
and
turned
eagerly
toward
robbie
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
nothing
had
happened
except
that
she
had
found
her
friend
but
mrs
weston’s
expression
had
changed
from
one
of
relief
to
one
of
dark
suspicion
she
turned
to
her
husband
and
despite
her
disheveled
and
undignified
appearance
managed
to
look
quite
formidable
you
engineered
this
didn’t
you
george
weston
swabbed
at
a
hot
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
his
hand
was
unsteady
and
his
lips
could
curve
only
into
a
tremulous
and
exceedingly
weak
smile
mrs
weston
pursued
the
thought
robbie
wasn’t
designed
for
engineering
or
construction
work
he
couldn’t
be
of
any
use
to
them
you
had
him
placed
there
deliberately
so
that
gloria
would
find
him
you
know
you
did
well
i
did
said
weston
but
grace
how
was
i
to
know
the
reunion
would
be
so
violent
and
robbie
has
saved
her
life
you’ll
have
to
admit
that
you
can’t
send
him
away
again
grace
weston
considered
she
turned
toward
gloria
and
robbie
and
watched
them
abstractedly
for
a
moment
gloria
had
a
grip
about
the
robot’s
neck
that
would
have
asphyxiated
any
creature
but
one
of
metal
and
was
prattling
nonsense
in
half-hysterical
frenzy
robbie’s
chrome-steel
arms
capable
of
bending
a
bar
of
steel
two
inches
in
diameter
into
a
pretzel
wound
about
the
little
girl
gently
and
lovingly
and
his
eyes
glowed
a
deep
deep
red
well
said
mrs
weston
at
last
i
guess
he
can
stay
with
us
until
he
rusts
susan
calvin
shrugged
her
shoulders
of
course
he
didn’t
that
was
1998
by
2002
we
had
invented
the
mobile
speaking
robot
which
of
course
made
all
the
non-speaking
models
out
of
date
and
which
seemed
to
be
the
final
straw
as
far
as
the
non-robot
elements
were
concerned
most
of
the
world
governments
banned
robot
use
on
earth
for
any
purpose
other
than
scientific
research
between
2003
and
2007
so
that
gloria
had
to
give
up
robbie
eventually
i’m
afraid
so
i
imagine
however
that
it
was
easier
for
her
at
the
age
of
fifteen
than
at
eight
still
it
was
a
stupid
and
unnecessary
attitude
on
the
part
of
humanity
u
s
robots
hit
its
low
point
financially
just
about
the
time
i
joined
them
in
2007
at
first
i
thought
my
job
might
come
to
a
sudden
end
in
a
matter
of
months
but
then
we
simply
developed
the
extra-terrestrial
market
and
then
you
were
set
of
course
not
quite
we
began
by
trying
to
adapt
the
models
we
had
on
hand
those
first
speaking
models
for
instance
they
were
about
twelve
feet
high
very
clumsy
and
not
much
good
we
sent
them
out
to
mercury
to
help
build
the
mining
station
there
but
that
failed
i
looked
up
in
surprise
it
did
why
mercury
mines
is
a
multi-billion
dollar
concern
it
is
now
but
it
was
a
second
attempt
that
succeeded
it
you
want
to
know
about
that
young
man
i’d
advise
you
to
look
up
gregory
powell
he
and
michael
donovan
handled
our
most
difficult
cases
in
the
teens
and
twenties
i
haven’t
heard
from
donovan
in
years
but
powell
is
living
right
here
in
new
york
he’s
a
grandfather
now
which
is
a
thought
difficult
to
get
used
to
i
can
only
think
of
him
as
a
rather
young
man
of
course
i
was
younger
too
i
tried
to
keep
her
talking
if
you
would
give
me
the
bare
bones
dr
calvin
i
can
have
mr
powell
fill
it
in
afterward
and
this
was
exactly
what
i
later
did
she
spread
her
thin
hands
out
upon
the
desk
and
looked
at
them
there
are
two
or
three
she
said
that
i
know
a
little
about
start
with
mercury
i
suggested
well
i
think
it
was
in
2015
that
the
second
mercury
expedition
was
sent
out
it
was
exploratory
and
financed
in
part
by
u
s
robots
and
in
part
by
solar
minerals
it
consisted
of
a
new-type
robot
still
experimental
gregory
powell
michael
donovan
runaround
it
was
one
of
gregory
powell’s
favorite
platitudes
that
nothing
was
to
be
gained
from
excitement
so
when
mike
donovan
came
leaping
down
the
stairs
toward
him
red
hair
matted
with
perspiration
powell
frowned
what’s
wrong
he
said
break
a
fingernail
yaaaah
snarled
donovan
feverishly
what
have
you
been
doing
in
the
sublevels
all
day
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
blurted
out
speedy
never
returned
powell’s
eyes
widened
momentarily
and
he
stopped
on
the
stairs
then
he
recovered
and
resumed
his
upward
steps
he
didn’t
speak
until
he
reached
the
head
of
the
flight
and
then
you
sent
him
after
the
selenium
yes
and
how
long
has
he
been
out
five
hours
now
silence
this
was
a
devil
of
a
situation
here
they
were
on
mercury
exactly
twelve
hours

and
already
up
to
the
eyebrows
in
the
worst
sort
of
trouble
mercury
had
long
been
the
jinx
world
of
the
system
but
this
was
drawing
it
rather
strong

even
for
a
jinx
powell
said
start
at
the
beginning
and
let’s
get
this
straight
they
were
in
the
radio
room
now

with
its
already
subtly
antiquated
equipment
untouched
for
the
ten
years
previous
to
their
arrival
even
ten
years
technologically
speaking
meant
so
much
compare
speedy
with
the
type
of
robot
they
must
have
had
back
in
2005
but
then
advances
in
robotics
these
days
were
tremendous
powell
touched
a
still
gleaming
metal
surface
gingerly
the
air
of
disuse
that
touched
everything
about
the
room

and
the
entire
station

was
infinitely
depressing
donovan
must
have
felt
it
he
began
i
tried
to
locate
him
by
radio
but
it
was
no
go
radio
isn’t
any
good
on
the
mercury
sunside

not
past
two
miles
anyway
that’s
one
of
the
reasons
the
first
expedition
failed
and
we
can’t
put
up
the
ultrawave
equipment
for
weeks
yet

skip
all
that
what
did
you
get
i
located
the
unorganized
body
signal
in
the
short
wave
it
was
no
good
for
anything
except
his
position
i
kept
track
of
him
that
way
for
two
hours
and
plotted
the
results
on
the
map
there
was
a
yellowed
square
of
parchment
in
his
hip
pocket

a
relic
of
the
unsuccessful
first
expedition

and
he
slapped
it
down
on
the
desk
with
vicious
force
spreading
it
flat
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
powell
hands
clasped
across
his
chest
watched
it
at
long
range
donovan’s
pencil
pointed
nervously
the
red
cross
is
the
selenium
pool
you
marked
it
yourself
which
one
is
it
interrupted
powell
there
were
three
that
macdougal
located
for
us
before
he
left
i
sent
speedy
to
the
nearest
naturally
seventeen
miles
away
but
what
difference
does
that
make
there
was
tension
in
his
voice
there
are
the
penciled
dots
that
mark
speedy’s
position
and
for
the
first
time
powell’s
artificial
aplomb
was
shaken
and
his
hands
shot
forward
for
the
map
are
you
serious
this
is
impossible
there
it
is
growled
donovan
the
little
dots
that
marked
the
position
formed
a
rough
circle
about
the
red
cross
of
the
selenium
pool
and
powell’s
fingers
went
to
his
brown
mustache
the
unfailing
signal
of
anxiety
donovan
added
in
the
two
hours
i
checked
on
him
he
circled
that
damned
pool
four
times
it
seems
likely
to
me
that
he’ll
keep
that
up
forever
do
you
realize
the
position
we’re
in
powell
looked
up
shortly
and
said
nothing
oh
yes
he
realized
the
position
they
were
in
it
worked
itself
out
as
simply
as
a
syllogism
the
photocell
banks
that
alone
stood
between
the
full
power
of
mercury’s
monstrous
sun
and
themselves
were
shot
to
hell
the
only
thing
that
could
save
them
was
selenium
the
only
thing
that
could
get
the
selenium
was
speedy
if
speedy
didn’t
come
back
no
selenium
no
selenium
no
photocell
banks
no
photo-banks

well
death
by
slow
broiling
is
one
of
the
more
unpleasant
ways
of
being
done
in
donovan
rubbed
his
red
mop
of
hair
savagely
and
expressed
himself
with
bitterness
we’ll
be
the
laughingstock
of
the
system
greg
how
can
everything
have
gone
so
wrong
so
soon
the
great
team
of
powell
and
donovan
is
sent
out
to
mercury
to
report
on
the
advisability
of
reopening
the
sunside
mining
station
with
modern
techniques
and
robots
and
we
ruin
everything
the
first
day
a
purely
routine
job
too
we’ll
never
live
it
down
we
won’t
have
to
perhaps
replied
powell
quietly
if
we
don’t
do
something
quickly
living
anything
down

or
even
just
plain
living

will
be
out
of
the
question
don’t
be
stupid
if
you
feel
funny
about
it
greg
i
don’t
it
was
criminal
sending
us
out
here
with
only
one
robot
and
it
was
your
bright
idea
that
we
could
handle
the
photocell
banks
ourselves
now
you’re
being
unfair
it
was
a
mutual
decision
and
you
know
it
all
we
needed
was
a
kilogram
of
selenium
a
stillhead
dielectrode
plate
and
about
three
hours
time
and
there
are
pools
of
pure
selenium
all
over
sunside
macdougal’s
spectroreflector
spotted
three
for
us
in
five
minutes
didn’t
it
what
the
devil
we
couldn’t
have
waited
for
next
conjunction
well
what
are
we
going
to
do
powell
you’ve
got
an
idea
i
know
you
have
or
you
wouldn’t
be
so
calm
you’re
no
more
a
hero
than
i
am
go
on
spill
it
we
can’t
go
after
speedy
ourselves
mike

not
on
the
sunside
even
the
new
insosuits
aren’t
good
for
more
than
twenty
minutes
in
direct
sunlight
but
you
know
the
old
saying
set
a
robot
to
catch
a
robot
look
mike
maybe
things
aren’t
so
bad
we’ve
got
six
robots
down
in
the
sublevels
that
we
may
be
able
to
use
if
they
work
if
they
work
there
was
a
glint
of
sudden
hope
in
donovan’s
eyes
you
mean
six
robots
from
the
first
expedition
are
you
sure
they
may
be
subrobotic
machines
ten
years
is
a
long
time
as
far
as
robot-types
are
concerned
you
know
no
they’re
robots
i’ve
spent
all
day
with
them
and
i
know
they’ve
got
positronic
brains
primitive
of
course
he
placed
the
map
in
his
pocket
let’s
go
down
the
robots
were
on
the
lowest
sublevel

all
six
of
them
surrounded
by
musty
packing
cases
of
uncertain
content
they
were
large
extremely
so
and
even
though
they
were
in
a
sitting
position
on
the
floor
legs
straddled
out
before
them
their
heads
were
a
good
seven
feet
in
the
air
donovan
whistled
look
at
the
size
of
them
will
you
the
chests
must
be
ten
feet
around
that’s
because
they’re
supplied
with
the
old
mcguffy
gears
i’ve
been
over
the
insides

crummiest
set
you’ve
ever
seen
have
you
powered
them
yet
no
there
wasn’t
any
reason
to
i
don’t
think
there’s
anything
wrong
with
them
even
the
diaphragm
is
in
reasonable
order
they
might
talk
he
had
unscrewed
the
chest
plate
of
the
nearest
as
he
spoke
inserted
the
two-inch
sphere
that
contained
the
tiny
spark
of
atomic
energy
that
was
a
robot’s
life
there
was
difficulty
in
fitting
it
but
he
managed
and
then
screwed
the
plate
back
on
again
in
laborious
fashion
the
radio
controls
of
more
modern
models
had
not
been
heard
of
ten
years
earlier
and
then
to
the
other
five
donovan
said
uneasily
they
haven’t
moved
no
orders
to
do
so
replied
powell
succinctly
he
went
back
to
the
first
in
the
line
and
struck
him
on
the
chest
you
do
you
hear
me
the
monster’s
head
bent
slowly
and
the
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
powell
then
in
a
harsh
squawking
voice

like
that
of
a
medieval
phonograph
he
grated
yes
master
powell
grinned
humorlessly
at
donovan
did
you
get
that
those
were
the
days
of
the
first
talking
robots
when
it
looked
as
if
the
use
of
robots
on
earth
would
be
banned
the
makers
were
fighting
that
and
they
built
good
healthy
slave
complexes
into
the
damned
machines
it
didn’t
help
them
muttered
donovan
no
it
didn’t
but
they
sure
tried
he
turned
once
more
to
the
robot
get
up
the
robot
towered
upward
slowly
and
donovan’s
head
craned
and
his
puckered
lips
whistled
powell
said
can
you
go
out
upon
the
surface
in
the
light
there
was
consideration
while
the
robot’s
slow
brain
worked
then
yes
master
good
do
you
know
what
a
mile
is
another
consideration
and
another
slow
answer
yes
master
we
will
take
you
up
to
the
surface
then
and
indicate
a
direction
you
will
go
about
seventeen
miles
and
somewhere
in
that
general
region
you
will
meet
another
robot
smaller
than
yourself
you
understand
so
far
yes
master
you
will
find
this
robot
and
order
him
to
return
if
he
does
not
wish
to
you
are
to
bring
him
back
by
force
donovan
clutched
at
powell’s
sleeve
why
not
send
him
for
the
selenium
direct
because
i
want
speedy
back
nitwit
i
want
to
find
out
what’s
wrong
with
him
and
to
the
robot
all
right
you
follow
me
the
robot
remained
motionless
and
his
voice
rumbled
pardon
master
but
i
cannot
you
must
mount
first
his
clumsy
arms
had
come
together
with
a
thwack
blunt
fingers
interlacing
powell
stared
and
then
pinched
at
his
mustache
uh
oh
donovan’s
eyes
bulged
we’ve
got
to
ride
him
like
a
horse
i
guess
that’s
the
idea
i
don’t
know
why
though
i
can’t
see

yes
i
do
i
told
you
they
were
playing
up
robot-safety
in
those
days
evidently
they
were
going
to
sell
the
notion
of
safety
by
not
allowing
them
to
move
about
without
a
mahout
on
their
shoulders
all
the
time
what
do
we
do
now
that’s
what
i’ve
been
thinking
muttered
donovan
we
can’t
go
out
on
the
surface
with
a
robot
or
without
oh
for
the
love
of
pete

and
he
snapped
his
fingers
twice
he
grew
excited
give
me
that
map
you’ve
got
i
haven’t
studied
it
for
two
hours
for
nothing
this
is
a
mining
station
what’s
wrong
with
using
the
tunnels
the
mining
station
was
a
black
circle
on
the
map
and
the
light
dotted
lines
that
were
tunnels
stretched
out
about
it
in
spider
web
fashion
donovan
studied
the
list
of
symbols
at
the
bottom
of
the
map
look
he
said
the
small
black
dots
are
openings
to
the
surface
and
here’s
one
maybe
three
miles
away
from
the
selenium
pool
there’s
a
number
here

you’d
think
they’d
write
larger

13a
if
the
robots
know
their
way
around
here
powell
shot
the
question
and
received
the
dull
yes
master
in
reply
get
your
insosuit
he
said
with
satisfaction
it
was
the
first
time
either
had
worn
the
insosuits

which
marked
one
time
more
than
either
had
expected
to
upon
their
arrival
the
day
before

and
they
tested
their
limb
movements
uncomfortably
the
insosuit
was
far
bulkier
and
far
uglier
than
the
regulation
spacesuit
but
withal
considerably
lighter
due
to
the
fact
that
they
were
entirely
nonmetallic
in
composition
composed
of
heat-resistant
plastic
and
chemically
treated
cork
layers
and
equipped
with
a
desiccating
unit
to
keep
the
air
bone-dry
the
insosuits
could
withstand
the
full
glare
of
mercury’s
sun
for
twenty
minutes
five
to
ten
minutes
more
as
well
without
actually
killing
the
occupant
and
still
the
robot’s
hands
formed
the
stirrup
nor
did
he
betray
the
slightest
atom
of
surprise
at
the
grotesque
figure
into
which
powell
had
been
converted
powell’s
radio-harshened
voice
boomed
out
are
you
ready
to
take
us
to
exit
13a
yes
master
good
thought
powell
they
might
lack
radio
control
but
at
least
they
were
fitted
for
radio
reception
mount
one
or
the
other
mike
he
said
to
donovan
he
placed
a
foot
in
the
improvised
stirrup
and
swung
upward
he
found
the
seat
comfortable
there
was
the
humped
back
of
the
robot
evidently
shaped
for
the
purpose
a
shallow
groove
along
each
shoulder
for
the
thighs
and
two
elongated
ears
whose
purpose
now
seemed
obvious
powell
seized
the
ears
and
twisted
the
head
his
mount
turned
ponderously
lead
on
macduff
but
he
did
not
feel
at
all
lighthearted
the
gigantic
robots
moved
slowly
with
mechanical
precision
through
the
doorway
that
cleared
their
heads
by
a
scant
foot
so
that
the
two
men
had
to
duck
hurriedly
along
a
narrow
corridor
in
which
their
unhurried
footsteps
boomed
monotonously
and
into
the
air
lock
the
long
airless
tunnel
that
stretched
to
a
pinpoint
before
them
brought
home
forcefully
to
powell
the
exact
magnitude
of
the
task
accomplished
by
the
first
expedition
with
their
crude
robots
and
their
start-from-scratch
necessities
they
might
have
been
a
failure
but
their
failure
was
a
good
deal
better
than
the
usual
run
of
the
system’s
successes
the
robots
plodded
onward
with
a
pace
that
never
varied
and
with
footsteps
that
never
lengthened
powell
said
notice
that
these
tunnels
are
blazing
with
lights
and
that
the
temperature
is
earth-normal
it’s
probably
been
like
this
all
the
ten
years
that
this
place
has
remained
empty
how’s
that
cheap
energy
cheapest
in
the
system
sunpower
you
know
and
on
mercury’s
sunside
sunpower
is
something
that’s
why
the
station
was
built
in
the
sunlight
rather
than
in
the
shadow
of
a
mountain
it’s
really
a
huge
energy
converter
the
heat
is
turned
into
electricity
light
mechanical
work
and
what
have
you
so
that
energy
is
supplied
and
the
station
is
cooled
in
a
simultaneous
process
look
said
donovan
this
is
all
very
educational
but
would
you
mind
changing
the
subject
it
so
happens
that
this
conversion
of
energy
that
you
talk
about
is
carried
on
by
the
photocell
banks
mainly

and
that
is
a
tender
subject
with
me
at
the
moment
powell
grunted
vaguely
and
when
donovan
broke
the
resulting
silence
it
was
to
change
the
subject
completely
listen
greg
what
the
devil’s
wrong
with
speedy
anyway
i
can’t
understand
it
it’s
not
easy
to
shrug
shoulders
in
an
insosuit
but
powell
tried
it
i
don’t
know
mike
you
know
he’s
perfectly
adapted
to
a
mercurian
environment
heat
doesn’t
mean
anything
to
him
and
he’s
built
for
the
light
gravity
and
the
broken
ground
he’s
foolproof

or
at
least
he
should
be
silence
fell
this
time
silence
that
lasted
master
said
the
robot
we
are
here
eh
powell
snapped
out
of
a
semidrowse
well
get
us
out
of
here

out
to
the
surface
they
found
themselves
in
a
tiny
substation
empty
airless
ruined
donovan
had
inspected
a
jagged
hole
in
the
upper
reaches
of
one
of
the
walls
by
the
light
of
his
pocket
flash
meteorite
do
you
suppose
he
had
asked
powell
shrugged
to
hell
with
that
it
doesn’t
matter
let’s
get
out
a
towering
cliff
of
a
black
basaltic
rock
cut
off
the
sunlight
and
the
deep
night
shadow
of
an
airless
world
surrounded
them
before
them
the
shadow
reached
out
and
ended
in
knife-edge
abruptness
into
an
all-but-unbearable
blaze
of
white
light
that
glittered
from
myriad
crystals
along
a
rocky
ground
space
gasped
donovan
it
looks
like
snow
and
it
did
powell’s
eyes
swept
the
jagged
glitter
of
mercury
to
the
horizon
and
winced
at
the
gorgeous
brilliance
this
must
be
an
unusual
area
he
said
the
general
albedo
of
mercury
is
low
and
most
of
the
soil
is
gray
pumice
something
like
the
moon
you
know
beautiful
isn’t
it
he
was
thankful
for
the
light
filters
in
their
visiplates
beautiful
or
not
a
look
at
the
sunlight
through
straight
glass
would
have
blinded
them
inside
of
half
a
minute
donovan
was
looking
at
the
spring
thermometer
on
his
wrist
holy
smokes
the
temperature
is
eighty
centigrade
powell
checked
his
own
and
said
um-m-m
a
little
high
atmosphere
you
know
on
mercury
are
you
nuts
mercury
isn’t
really
airless
explained
powell
in
absentminded
fashion
he
was
adjusting
the
binocular
attachments
to
his
visiplate
and
the
bloated
fingers
of
the
insosuit
were
clumsy
at
it
there
is
a
thin
exhalation
that
clings
to
its
surface

vapors
of
the
more
volatile
elements
and
compounds
that
are
heavy
enough
for
mercurian
gravity
to
retain
you
know
selenium
iodine
mercury
gallium
potassium
bismuth
volatile
oxides
the
vapors
sweep
into
the
shadows
and
condense
giving
up
heat
it’s
a
sort
of
gigantic
still
in
fact
if
you
use
your
flash
you’ll
probably
find
that
the
side
of
the
cliff
is
covered
with
say
hoar-sulphur
or
maybe
quicksilver
dew
it
doesn’t
matter
though
our
suits
can
stand
a
measly
eighty
indefinitely
powell
had
adjusted
the
binocular
attachments
so
that
he
seemed
as
eye-stalked
as
a
snail
donovan
watched
tensely
see
anything
the
other
did
not
answer
immediately
and
when
he
did
his
voice
was
anxious
and
thoughtful
there’s
a
dark
spot
on
the
horizon
that
might
be
the
selenium
pool
it’s
in
the
right
place
but
i
don’t
see
speedy
powell
clambered
upward
in
an
instinctive
striving
for
better
view
till
he
was
standing
in
unsteady
fashion
upon
his
robot’s
shoulders
legs
straddled
wide
eyes
straining
he
said
i
think
i
think
yes
it’s
definitely
he
he’s
coming
this
way
donovan
followed
the
pointing
finger
he
had
no
binoculars
but
there
was
a
tiny
moving
dot
black
against
the
blazing
brilliance
of
the
crystalline
ground
i
see
him
he
yelled
let’s
get
going
powell
had
hopped
down
into
a
sitting
position
on
the
robot
again
and
his
suited
hand
slapped
against
the
gargantuan’s
barrel
chest
get
going
giddy-ap
yelled
donovan
and
thumped
his
heels
spur
fashion
the
robots
started
off
the
regular
thudding
of
their
footsteps
silent
in
the
airlessness
for
the
nonmetallic
fabric
of
the
insosuits
did
not
transmit
sound
there
was
only
a
rhythmic
vibration
just
below
the
border
of
actual
hearing
faster
yelled
donovan
the
rhythm
did
not
change
no
use
cried
powell
in
reply
these
junk
heaps
are
only
geared
to
one
speed
do
you
think
they’re
equipped
with
selective
flexors
they
had
burst
through
the
shadow
and
the
sunlight
came
down
in
a
white-hot
wash
and
poured
liquidly
about
them
donovan
ducked
involuntarily
wow
is
it
imagination
or
do
i
feel
heat
you’ll
feel
more
presently
was
the
grim
reply
keep
your
eye
on
speedy
robot
spd
13
was
near
enough
to
be
seen
in
detail
now
his
graceful
streamlined
body
threw
out
blazing
highlights
as
he
loped
with
easy
speed
across
the
broken
ground
his
name
was
derived
from
his
serial
initials
of
course
but
it
was
apt
nevertheless
for
the
spd
models
were
among
the
fastest
robots
turned
out
by
the
united
states
robot

mechanical
men
corp
hey
speedy
howled
donovan
and
waved
a
frantic
hand
speedy
shouted
powell
come
here
the
distance
between
the
men
and
the
errant
robot
was
being
cut
down
momentarily

more
by
the
efforts
of
speedy
than
the
slow
plodding
of
the
fifty-year-old
antique
mounts
of
donovan
and
powell
they
were
close
enough
now
to
notice
that
speedy’s
gait
included
a
peculiar
rolling
stagger
a
noticeable
side-to-side
lurch

and
then
as
powell
waved
his
hand
again
and
sent
maximum
juice
into
his
compact
headset
radio
sender
in
preparation
for
another
shout
speedy
looked
up
and
saw
them
speedy
hopped
to
a
halt
and
remained
standing
for
a
moment
with
just
a
tiny
unsteady
weave
as
though
he
were
swaying
in
a
light
wind
powell
yelled
all
right
speedy
come
here
boy
whereupon
speedy’s
robot
voice
sounded
in
powell’s
earphones
for
the
first
time
it
said
hot
dog
let’s
play
games
you
catch
me
and
i
catch
you
no
love
can
cut
our
knife
in
two
for
i’m
little
buttercup
sweet
little
buttercup
whoops
turning
on
his
heel
he
sped
off
in
the
direction
from
which
he
had
come
with
a
speed
and
fury
that
kicked
up
gouts
of
baked
dust
and
his
last
words
as
he
receded
into
the
distance
were
there
grew
a
little
flower
neath
a
great
oak
tree
followed
by
a
curious
metallic
clicking
that
might
have
been
a
robotic
equivalent
of
a
hiccup
donovan
said
weakly
where
did
he
pick
up
the
gilbert
and
sullivan
say
greg
he
he’s
drunk
or
something
if
you
hadn’t
told
me
was
the
bitter
response
i’d
never
realize
it
let’s
get
back
to
the
cliff
i’m
roasting
it
was
powell
who
broke
the
desperate
silence
in
the
first
place
he
said
speedy
isn’t
drunk

not
in
the
human
sense

because
he’s
a
robot
and
robots
don’t
get
drunk
however
there’s
something
wrong
with
him
which
is
the
robotic
equivalent
of
drunkenness
to
me
he’s
drunk
stated
donovan
emphatically
and
all
i
know
is
that
he
thinks
we’re
playing
games
and
we’re
not
it’s
a
matter
of
life
and
very
gruesome
death
all
right
don’t
hurry
me
a
robot’s
only
a
robot
once
we
find
out
what’s
wrong
with
him
we
can
fix
it
and
go
on
once
said
donovan
sourly
powell
ignored
him
speedy
is
perfectly
adapted
to
normal
mercurian
environment
but
this
region

and
his
arm
swept
wide

is
definitely
abnormal
there’s
our
clue
now
where
do
these
crystals
come
from
they
might
have
formed
from
a
slowly
cooling
liquid
but
where
would
you
get
liquid
so
hot
that
it
would
cool
in
mercury’s
sun
volcanic
action
suggested
donovan
instantly
and
powell’s
body
tensed
out
of
the
mouths
of
sucklings
he
said
in
a
small
strange
voice
and
remained
very
still
for
five
minutes
then
he
said
listen
mike
what
did
you
say
to
speedy
when
you
sent
him
after
the
selenium
donovan
was
taken
aback
well
damn
it

i
don’t
know
i
just
told
him
to
get
it
yes
i
know
but
how
try
to
remember
the
exact
words
i
said
uh
i
said
speedy
we
need
some
selenium
you
can
get
it
such-and-such
a
place
go
get
it

that’s
all
what
more
did
you
want
me
to
say
you
didn’t
put
any
urgency
into
the
order
did
you
what
for
it
was
pure
routine
powell
sighed
well
it
can’t
be
helped
now

but
we’re
in
a
fine
fix
he
had
dismounted
from
his
robot
and
was
sitting
back
against
the
cliff
donovan
joined
him
and
they
linked
arms
in
the
distance
the
burning
sunlight
seemed
to
wait
cat-and-mouse
for
them
and
just
next
them
the
two
giant
robots
were
invisible
but
for
the
dull
red
of
their
photoelectric
eyes
that
stared
down
at
them
unblinking
unwavering
and
unconcerned
unconcerned
as
was
all
this
poisonous
mercury
as
large
in
jinx
as
it
was
small
in
size
powell’s
radio
voice
was
tense
in
donovan’s
ear
now
look
let’s
start
with
the
three
fundamental
rules
of
robotics

the
three
rules
that
are
built
most
deeply
into
a
robot’s
positronic
brain
in
the
darkness
his
gloved
fingers
ticked
off
each
point
we
have
one
a
robot
may
not
injure
a
human
being
or
through
inaction
allow
a
human
being
to
come
to
harm
right
two
continued
powell
a
robot
must
obey
the
orders
given
it
by
human
beings
except
where
such
orders
would
conflict
with
the
first
law
right
and
three
a
robot
must
protect
its
own
existence
as
long
as
such
protection
does
not
conflict
with
the
first
or
second
laws
right
now
where
are
we
exactly
at
the
explanation
the
conflict
between
the
various
rules
is
ironed
out
by
the
different
positronic
potentials
in
the
brain
we’ll
say
that
a
robot
is
walking
into
danger
and
knows
it
the
automatic
potential
that
rule
3
sets
up
turns
him
back
but
suppose
you
order
him
to
walk
into
that
danger
in
that
case
rule
2
sets
up
a
counterpotential
higher
than
the
previous
one
and
the
robot
follows
orders
at
the
risk
of
existence
well
i
know
that
what
about
it
let’s
take
speedy’s
case
speedy
is
one
of
the
latest
models
extremely
specialized
and
as
expensive
as
a
battleship
it’s
not
a
thing
to
be
lightly
destroyed
so
so
rule
3
has
been
strengthened

that
was
specifically
mentioned
by
the
way
in
the
advance
notices
on
the
spd
models

so
that
his
allergy
to
danger
is
unusually
high
at
the
same
time
when
you
sent
him
out
after
the
selenium
you
gave
him
his
order
casually
and
without
special
emphasis
so
that
the
rule
2
potential
set-up
was
rather
weak
now
hold
on
i’m
just
stating
facts
all
right
go
ahead
i
think
i
get
it
you
see
how
it
works
don’t
you
there’s
some
sort
of
danger
centering
at
the
selenium
pool
it
increases
as
he
approaches
and
at
a
certain
distance
from
it
the
rule
3
potential
unusually
high
to
start
with
exactly
balances
the
rule
2
potential
unusually
low
to
start
with
donovan
rose
to
his
feet
in
excitement

and
it
strikes
an
equilibrium
i
see
rule
3
drives
him
back
and
rule
2
drives
him
forward
so
he
follows
a
circle
around
the
selenium
pool
staying
on
the
locus
of
all
points
of
potential
equilibrium
and
unless
we
do
something
about
it
he’ll
stay
on
that
circle
forever
giving
us
the
good
old
runaround
then
more
thoughtfully
and
that
by
the
way
is
what
makes
him
drunk
at
potential
equilibrium
half
the
positronic
paths
of
his
brain
are
out
of
kilter
i’m
not
a
robot
specialist
but
that
seems
obvious
probably
he’s
lost
control
of
just
those
parts
of
his
voluntary
mechanism
that
a
human
drunk
has
ve-e-ery
pretty
but
what’s
the
danger
if
we
knew
what
he
was
running
from
you
suggested
it
volcanic
action
somewhere
right
above
the
selenium
pool
is
a
seepage
of
gas
from
the
bowels
of
mercury
sulphur
dioxide
carbon
dioxide

and
carbon
monoxide
lots
of
it
and
at
this
temperature
donovan
gulped
audibly
carbon
monoxide
plus
iron
gives
the
volatile
iron
carbonyl
and
a
robot
added
powell
is
essentially
iron
then
grimly
there’s
nothing
like
deduction
we’ve
determined
everything
about
our
problem
but
the
solution
we
can’t
get
the
selenium
ourselves
it’s
still
too
far
we
can’t
send
these
robot
horses
because
they
can’t
go
themselves
and
they
can’t
carry
us
fast
enough
to
keep
us
from
crisping
and
we
can’t
catch
speedy
because
the
dope
thinks
we’re
playing
games
and
he
can
run
sixty
miles
to
our
four
if
one
of
us
goes
began
donovan
tentatively
and
comes
back
cooked
there’ll
still
be
the
other
yes
came
the
sarcastic
reply
it
would
be
a
most
tender
sacrifice

except
that
a
person
would
be
in
no
condition
to
give
orders
before
he
ever
reached
the
pool
and
i
don’t
think
the
robots
would
ever
turn
back
to
the
cliff
without
orders
figure
it
out
we’re
two
or
three
miles
from
the
pool

call
it
two

the
robot
travels
at
four
miles
an
hour
and
we
can
last
twenty
minutes
in
our
suits
it
isn’t
only
the
heat
remember
solar
radiation
out
here
in
the
ultraviolet
and
below
is
poison
um-m-m
said
donovan
ten
minutes
short
as
good
as
an
eternity
and
another
thing
in
order
for
rule
3
potential
to
have
stopped
speedy
where
it
did
there
must
be
an
appreciable
amount
of
carbon
monoxide
in
the
metal-vapor
atmosphere

and
there
must
be
an
appreciable
corrosive
action
therefore
he’s
been
out
hours
now

and
how
do
we
know
when
a
knee
joint
for
instance
won’t
be
thrown
out
of
kilter
and
keel
him
over
it’s
not
only
a
question
of
thinking

we’ve
got
to
think
fast
deep
dark
dank
dismal
silence
donovan
broke
it
voice
trembling
in
an
effort
to
keep
itself
emotionless
he
said
as
long
as
we
can’t
increase
rule
2
potential
by
giving
further
orders
how
about
working
the
other
way
if
we
increase
the
danger
we
increase
rule
3
potential
and
drive
him
backward
powell’s
visiplate
had
turned
toward
him
in
a
silent
question
you
see
came
the
cautious
explanation
all
we
need
to
do
to
drive
him
out
of
his
rut
is
to
increase
the
concentration
of
carbon
monoxide
in
his
vicinity
well
back
at
the
station
there’s
a
complete
analytical
laboratory
naturally
assented
powell
it’s
a
mining
station
all
right
there
must
be
pounds
of
oxalic
acid
for
calcium
precipitations
holy
space
mike
you’re
a
genius
so-so
admitted
donovan
modestly
it’s
just
a
case
of
remembering
that
oxalic
acid
on
heating
decomposes
into
carbon
dioxide
water
and
good
old
carbon
monoxide
college
chem
you
know
powell
was
on
his
feet
and
had
attracted
the
attention
of
one
of
the
monster
robots
by
the
simple
expedient
of
pounding
the
machine’s
thigh
hey
he
shouted
can
you
throw
master
never
mind
powell
damned
the
robot’s
molasses-slow
brain
he
scrabbled
up
a
jagged
brick-size
rock
take
this
he
said
and
hit
the
patch
of
bluish
crystals
just
across
the
crooked
fissure
you
see
it
donovan
pulled
at
his
shoulder
too
far
greg
it’s
almost
half
a
mile
off
quiet
replied
powell
it’s
a
case
of
mercurian
gravity
and
a
steel
throwing
arm
watch
will
you
the
robot’s
eyes
were
measuring
the
distance
with
machinely
accurate
stereoscopy
his
arm
adjusted
itself
to
the
weight
of
the
missile
and
drew
back
in
the
darkness
the
robot’s
motions
went
unseen
but
there
was
a
sudden
thumping
sound
as
he
shifted
his
weight
and
seconds
later
the
rock
flew
blackly
into
the
sunlight
there
was
no
air
resistance
to
slow
it
down
nor
wind
to
turn
it
aside
and
when
it
hit
the
ground
it
threw
up
crystals
precisely
in
the
center
of
the
blue
patch
powell
yelled
happily
and
shouted
let’s
go
back
after
the
oxalic
acid
mike
and
as
they
plunged
into
the
ruined
substation
on
the
way
back
to
the
tunnels
donovan
said
grimly
speedy’s
been
hanging
about
on
this
side
of
the
selenium
pool
ever
since
we
chased
after
him
did
you
see
him
yes
i
guess
he
wants
to
play
games
well
we’ll
play
him
games
they
were
back
hours
later
with
three-liter
jars
of
the
white
chemical
and
a
pair
of
long
faces
the
photocell
banks
were
deteriorating
more
rapidly
than
had
seemed
likely
the
two
steered
their
robots
into
the
sunlight
and
toward
the
waiting
speedy
in
silence
and
with
grim
purpose
speedy
galloped
slowly
toward
them
here
we
are
again
whee
i’ve
made
a
little
list
the
piano
organist
all
people
who
eat
peppermint
and
puff
it
in
your
face
we’ll
puff
something
in
your
face
muttered
donovan
he’s
limping
greg
i
noticed
that
came
the
low
worried
response
the
monoxide’ll
get
him
yet
if
we
don’t
hurry
they
were
approaching
cautiously
now
almost
sidling
to
refrain
from
setting
off
the
thoroughly
irrational
robot
powell
was
too
far
off
to
tell
of
course
but
even
already
he
could
have
sworn
the
crack-brained
speedy
was
setting
himself
for
a
spring
let
her
go
he
gasped
count
three
one
two
two
steel
arms
drew
back
and
snapped
forward
simultaneously
and
two
glass
jars
whirled
forward
in
towering
parallel
arcs
gleaming
like
diamonds
in
the
impossible
sun
and
in
a
pair
of
soundless
puffs
they
hit
the
ground
behind
speedy
in
crashes
that
sent
the
oxalic
acid
flying
like
dust
in
the
full
heat
of
mercury’s
sun
powell
knew
it
was
fizzing
like
soda
water
speedy
turned
to
stare
then
backed
away
from
it
slowly

and
as
slowly
gathered
speed
in
fifteen
seconds
he
was
leaping
directly
toward
the
two
humans
in
an
unsteady
canter
powell
did
not
get
speedy’s
words
just
then
though
he
heard
something
that
resembled
lover’s
professions
when
uttered
in
hessians
he
turned
away
back
to
the
cliff
mike
he’s
out
of
the
rut
and
he’ll
be
taking
orders
now
i’m
getting
hot
they
jogged
toward
the
shadow
at
the
slow
monotonous
pace
of
their
mounts
and
it
was
not
until
they
had
entered
it
and
felt
the
sudden
coolness
settle
softly
about
them
that
donovan
looked
back
greg
powell
looked
and
almost
shrieked
speedy
was
moving
slowly
now

so
slowly

and
in
the
wrong
direction
he
was
drifting
drifting
back
into
his
rut
and
he
was
picking
up
speed
he
looked
dreadfully
close
and
dreadfully
unreachable
in
the
binoculars
donovan
shouted
wildly
after
him
and
thumped
his
robot
into
its
pace
but
powell
called
him
back
you
won’t
catch
him
mike

it’s
no
use
he
fidgeted
on
his
robot’s
shoulders
and
clenched
his
fist
in
tight
impotence
why
the
devil
do
i
see
these
things
five
seconds
after
it’s
all
over
mike
we’ve
wasted
hours
we
need
more
oxalic
acid
declared
donovan
stolidly
the
concentration
wasn’t
high
enough
seven
tons
of
it
wouldn’t
have
been
enough

and
we
haven’t
the
hours
to
spare
to
get
it
even
if
it
were
with
the
monoxide
chewing
him
away
don’t
you
see
what
it
is
mike
and
donovan
said
flatly
no
we
were
only
establishing
new
equilibriums
when
we
create
new
monoxide
and
increase
rule
3
potential
he
moves
backward
till
he’s
in
balance
again

and
when
the
monoxide
drifted
away
he
moved
forward
and
again
there
was
balance
powell’s
voice
sounded
thoroughly
wretched
it’s
the
same
old
runaround
we
can
push
at
rule
2
and
pull
at
rule
3
and
we
can’t
get
anywhere

we
can
only
change
the
position
of
balance
we’ve
got
to
get
outside
both
rules
and
then
he
pushed
his
robot
closer
to
donovan’s
so
that
they
were
sitting
face-to-face
dim
shadows
in
the
darkness
and
he
whispered
mike
is
it
the
finish

dully
i
suppose
we
go
back
to
the
station
wait
for
the
banks
to
fold
shake
hands
take
cyanide
and
go
out
like
gentlemen
he
laughed
shortly
mike
repeated
powell
earnestly
we’ve
got
to
get
speedy
i
know
mike
once
more
and
powell
hesitated
before
continuing
there’s
always
rule
1
i
thought
of
it
earlier

but
it’s
desperate
donovan
looked
up
and
his
voice
livened
we’re
desperate
all
right
according
to
rule
1
a
robot
can’t
see
a
human
come
to
harm
because
of
his
own
inaction
two
and
3
can’t
stand
against
it
they
can’t
mike
even
when
the
robot
is
half
cra
well
he’s
drunk
you
know
he
is
it’s
the
chances
you
take
cut
it
what
are
you
going
to
do
i’m
going
out
there
now
and
see
what
rule
1
will
do
if
it
won’t
break
the
balance
then
what
the
devil

it’s
either
now
or
three-four
days
from
now
hold
on
greg
there
are
human
rules
of
behavior
too
you
don’t
go
out
there
just
like
that
figure
out
a
lottery
and
give
me
my
chance
all
right
first
to
get
the
cube
of
fourteen
goes
and
almost
immediately
twenty-seven
forty
four
donovan
felt
his
robot
stagger
at
a
sudden
push
by
powell’s
mount
and
then
powell
was
off
into
the
sunlight
donovan
opened
his
mouth
to
shout
and
then
clicked
it
shut
of
course
the
damn
fool
had
worked
out
the
cube
of
fourteen
in
advance
and
on
purpose
just
like
him
the
sun
was
hotter
than
ever
and
powell
felt
a
maddening
itch
in
the
small
of
his
back
imagination
probably
or
perhaps
hard
radiation
beginning
to
tell
even
through
the
insosuit
speedy
was
watching
him
without
a
word
of
gilbert
and
sullivan
gibberish
as
greeting
thank
god
for
that
but
he
daren’t
get
too
close
he
was
three
hundred
yards
away
when
speedy
began
backing
a
step
at
a
time
cautiously

and
powell
stopped
he
jumped
from
his
robot’s
shoulders
and
landed
on
the
crystalline
ground
with
a
light
thump
and
a
flying
of
jagged
fragments
he
proceeded
on
foot
the
ground
gritty
and
slippery
to
his
steps
the
low
gravity
causing
him
difficulty
the
soles
of
his
feet
tickled
with
warmth
he
cast
one
glance
over
his
shoulder
at
the
blackness
of
the
cliff’s
shadow
and
realized
that
he
had
come
too
far
to
return

either
by
himself
or
by
the
help
of
his
antique
robot
it
was
speedy
or
nothing
now
and
the
knowledge
of
that
constricted
his
chest
far
enough
he
stopped
speedy
he
called
speedy
the
sleek
modern
robot
ahead
of
him
hesitated
and
halted
his
backward
steps
then
resumed
them
powell
tried
to
put
a
note
of
pleading
into
his
voice
and
found
it
didn’t
take
much
acting
speedy
i’ve
got
to
get
back
to
the
shadow
or
the
sun’ll
get
me
it’s
life
or
death
speedy
i
need
you
speedy
took
one
step
forward
and
stopped
he
spoke
but
at
the
sound
powell
groaned
for
it
was
when
you’re
lying
awake
with
a
dismal
headache
and
repose
is
tabooed
it
trailed
off
there
and
powell
took
time
out
for
some
reason
to
murmur
iolanthe
it
was
roasting
hot
he
caught
a
movement
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
whirled
dizzily
then
stared
in
utter
astonishment
for
the
monstrous
robot
on
which
he
had
ridden
was
moving

moving
toward
him
and
without
a
rider
he
was
talking
pardon
master
i
must
not
move
without
a
master
upon
me
but
you
are
in
danger
of
course
rule
1
potential
above
everything
but
he
didn’t
want
that
clumsy
antique
he
wanted
speedy
he
walked
away
and
motioned
frantically
i
order
you
to
stay
away
i
order
you
to
stop
it
was
quite
useless
you
could
not
beat
rule
1
potential
the
robot
said
stupidly
you
are
in
danger
master
powell
looked
about
him
desperately
he
couldn’t
see
clearly
his
brain
was
in
a
heated
whirl
his
breath
scorched
when
he
breathed
and
the
ground
all
about
him
was
a
shimmering
haze
he
called
a
last
time
desperately
speedy
i’m
dying
damn
you
where
are
you
speedy
i
need
you
he
was
still
stumbling
backward
in
a
blind
effort
to
get
away
from
the
giant
robot
he
didn’t
want
when
he
felt
steel
fingers
on
his
arms
and
a
worried
apologetic
voice
of
metallic
timbre
in
his
ears
holy
smokes
boss
what
are
you
doing
here
and
what
am
i
doing

i’m
so
confused

never
mind
murmured
powell
weakly
get
me
to
the
shadow
of
the
cliff

and
hurry
there
was
one
last
feeling
of
being
lifted
into
the
air
and
a
sensation
of
rapid
motion
and
burning
heat
and
he
passed
out
he
woke
with
donovan
bending
over
him
and
smiling
anxiously
how
are
you
greg
fine
came
the
response
where’s
speedy
right
here
i
sent
him
out
to
one
of
the
other
selenium
pools

with
orders
to
get
that
selenium
at
all
cost
this
time
he
got
it
back
in
forty-two
minutes
and
three
seconds
i
timed
him
he
still
hasn’t
finished
apologizing
for
the
runaround
he
gave
us
he’s
scared
to
come
near
you
for
fear
of
what
you’ll
say
drag
him
over
ordered
powell
it
wasn’t
his
fault
he
held
out
a
hand
and
gripped
speedy’s
metal
paw
it’s
o.k
speedy
then
to
donovan
you
know
mike
i
was
just
thinking
yes
well

he
rubbed
his
face

the
air
was
so
delightfully
cool
you
know
that
when
we
get
things
set
up
here
and
speedy
put
through
his
field
tests
they’re
going
to
send
us
to
the
space
stations
next
no
yes
at
least
that’s
what
old
lady
calvin
told
me
just
before
we
left
and
i
didn’t
say
anything
about
it
because
i
was
going
to
fight
the
whole
idea
fight
it
cried
donovan
but

i
know
it’s
all
right
with
me
now
two
hundred
seventy-three
degrees
centigrade
below
zero
won’t
it
be
a
pleasure
space
station
said
donovan
here
i
come
reason
half
a
year
later
the
boys
had
changed
their
minds
the
flame
of
a
giant
sun
had
given
way
to
the
soft
blackness
of
space
but
external
variations
mean
little
in
the
business
of
checking
the
workings
of
experimental
robots
whatever
the
background
one
is
face
to
face
with
an
inscrutable
positronic
brain
which
the
slide-rule
geniuses
say
should
work
thus-and-so
except
that
they
don’t
powell
and
donovan
found
that
out
after
they
had
been
on
the
station
less
than
two
weeks
gregory
powell
spaced
his
words
for
emphasis
one
week
ago
donovan
and
i
put
you
together
his
brows
furrowed
doubtfully
and
he
pulled
the
end
of
his
brown
mustache
it
was
quiet
in
the
officer’s
room
on
solar
station
5

except
for
the
soft
purring
of
the
mighty
beam
director
somewhere
far
below
robot
qt-1
sat
immovable
the
burnished
plates
of
his
body
gleamed
in
the
luxites
and
the
glowing
red
of
the
photoelectric
cells
that
were
his
eyes
were
fixed
steadily
upon
the
earthman
at
the
other
side
of
the
table
powell
repressed
a
sudden
attack
of
nerves
these
robots
possessed
peculiar
brains
oh
the
three
laws
of
robotics
held
they
had
to
all
of
u
s
robots
from
robertson
himself
to
the
new
floor-sweeper
would
insist
on
that
so
qt-1
was
safe
and
yet
the
qt
models
were
the
first
of
their
kind
and
this
was
the
first
of
the
qt’s
mathematical
squiggles
on
paper
were
not
always
the
most
comforting
protection
against
robotic
fact
finally
the
robot
spoke
his
voice
carried
the
cold
timbre
inseparable
from
a
metallic
diaphragm
do
you
realize
the
seriousness
of
such
a
statement
powell
something
made
you
cutie
pointed
out
powell
you
admit
yourself
that
your
memory
seems
to
spring
full-grown
from
an
absolute
blankness
of
a
week
ago
i’m
giving
you
the
explanation
donovan
and
i
put
you
together
from
the
parts
shipped
us
cutie
gazed
upon
his
long
supple
fingers
in
an
oddly
human
attitude
of
mystification
it
strikes
me
that
there
should
be
a
more
satisfactory
explanation
than
that
for
you
to
make
me
seems
improbable
the
earthman
laughed
quite
suddenly
in
earth’s
name
why
call
it
intuition
that’s
all
it
is
so
far
but
i
intend
to
reason
it
out
though
a
chain
of
valid
reasoning
can
end
only
with
the
determination
of
truth
and
i’ll
stick
till
i
get
there
powell
stood
up
and
seated
himself
at
the
table’s
edge
next
to
the
robot
he
felt
a
sudden
strong
sympathy
for
this
strange
machine
it
was
not
at
all
like
the
ordinary
robot
attending
to
his
specialized
task
at
the
station
with
the
intensity
of
a
deeply
ingrooved
positronic
path
he
placed
a
hand
upon
cutie’s
steel
shoulder
and
the
metal
was
cold
and
hard
to
the
touch
cutie
he
said
i’m
going
to
try
to
explain
something
to
you
you’re
the
first
robot
who’s
ever
exhibited
curiosity
as
to
his
own
existence

and
i
think
the
first
that’s
really
intelligent
enough
to
understand
the
world
outside
here
come
with
me
the
robot
rose
erect
smoothly
and
his
thickly
sponge-rubber
soled
feet
made
no
noise
as
he
followed
powell
the
earthman
touched
a
button
and
a
square
section
of
the
wall
flickered
aside
the
thick
clear
glass
revealed
space

star
speckled
i’ve
seen
that
in
the
observation
ports
in
the
engine
room
said
cutie
i
know
said
powell
what
do
you
think
it
is
exactly
what
it
seems

a
black
material
just
beyond
this
glass
that
is
spotted
with
little
gleaming
dots
i
know
that
our
director
sends
out
beams
to
some
of
these
dots
always
to
the
same
ones

and
also
that
these
dots
shift
and
that
the
beams
shift
with
them
that
is
all
good
now
i
want
you
to
listen
carefully
the
blackness
is
emptiness
vast
emptiness
stretching
out
infinitely
the
little
gleaming
dots
are
huge
masses
of
energy-filled
matter
they
are
globes
some
of
them
millions
of
miles
in
diameter
and
for
comparison
this
station
is
only
one
mile
across
they
seem
so
tiny
because
they
are
incredibly
far
off
the
dots
to
which
our
energy
beams
are
directed
are
nearer
and
much
smaller
they
are
cold
and
hard
and
human
beings
like
myself
live
upon
their
surfaces

many
billions
of
them
it
is
from
one
of
these
worlds
that
donovan
and
i
come
our
beams
feed
these
worlds
energy
drawn
from
one
of
those
huge
incandescent
globes
that
happens
to
be
near
us
we
call
that
globe
the
sun
and
it
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
station
where
you
can’t
see
it
cutie
remained
motionless
before
the
port
like
a
steel
statue
his
head
did
not
turn
as
he
spoke
which
particular
dot
of
light
do
you
claim
to
come
from
powell
searched
there
it
is
the
very
bright
one
in
the
corner
we
call
it
earth
he
grinned
good
old
earth
there
are
three
billions
of
us
there
cutie

and
in
about
two
weeks
i’ll
be
back
there
with
them
and
then
surprisingly
enough
cutie
hummed
abstractedly
there
was
no
tune
to
it
but
it
possessed
a
curious
twanging
quality
as
of
plucked
strings
it
ceased
as
suddenly
as
it
had
begun
but
where
do
i
come
in
powell
you
haven’t
explained
my
existence
the
rest
is
simple
when
these
stations
were
first
established
to
feed
solar
energy
to
the
planets
they
were
run
by
humans
however
the
heat
the
hard
solar
radiations
and
the
electron
storms
made
the
post
a
difficult
one
robots
were
developed
to
replace
human
labor
and
now
only
two
human
executives
are
required
for
each
station
we
are
trying
to
replace
even
those
and
that’s
where
you
come
in
you’re
the
highest
type
of
robot
ever
developed
and
if
you
show
the
ability
to
run
this
station
independently
no
human
need
ever
come
here
again
except
to
bring
parts
for
repairs
his
hand
went
up
and
the
metal
visi-lid
snapped
back
into
place
powell
returned
to
the
table
and
polished
an
apple
upon
his
sleeve
before
biting
into
it
the
red
glow
of
the
robot’s
eyes
held
him
do
you
expect
me
said
cutie
slowly
to
believe
any
such
complicated
implausible
hypothesis
as
you
have
just
outlined
what
do
you
take
me
for
powell
sputtered
apple
fragments
onto
the
table
and
turned
red
why
damn
you
it
wasn’t
a
hypothesis
those
were
facts
cutie
sounded
grim
globes
of
energy
millions
of
miles
across
worlds
with
three
billion
humans
on
them
infinite
emptiness
sorry
powell
but
i
don’t
believe
it
i’ll
puzzle
this
thing
out
for
myself
good-by
he
turned
and
stalked
out
of
the
room
he
brushed
past
michael
donovan
on
the
threshold
with
a
grave
nod
and
passed
down
the
corridor
oblivious
to
the
astounded
stare
that
followed
him
mike
donovan
rumpled
his
red
hair
and
shot
an
annoyed
glance
at
powell
what
was
that
walking
junk
yard
talking
about
what
doesn’t
he
believe
the
other
dragged
at
his
mustache
bitterly
he’s
a
skeptic
was
the
bitter
response
he
doesn’t
believe
we
made
him
or
that
earth
exists
or
space
or
stars
sizzling
saturn
we’ve
got
a
lunatic
robot
on
our
hands
he
says
he’s
going
to
figure
it
all
out
for
himself
well
now
said
donovan
sweetly
i
do
hope
he’ll
condescend
to
explain
it
all
to
me
after
he’s
puzzled
everything
out
then
with
sudden
rage
listen
if
that
metal
mess
gives
me
any
lip
like
that
i’ll
knock
that
chromium
cranium
right
off
its
torso
he
seated
himself
with
a
jerk
and
drew
a
paper-backed
mystery
novel
out
of
his
inner
jacket
pocket
that
robot
gives
me
the
willies
anyway

too
damned
inquisitive
mike
donovan
growled
from
behind
a
huge
lettuce-and-tomato
sandwich
as
cutie
knocked
gently
and
entered
is
powell
here
donovan’s
voice
was
muffled
with
pauses
for
mastication
he’s
gathering
data
on
electronic
stream
functions
we’re
heading
for
a
storm
looks
like
gregory
powell
entered
as
he
spoke
eyes
on
the
graphed
paper
in
his
hands
and
dropped
into
a
chair
he
spread
the
sheets
out
before
him
and
began
scribbling
calculations
donovan
stared
over
his
shoulder
crunching
lettuce
and
dribbling
breadcrumbs
cutie
waited
silently
powell
looked
up
the
zeta
potential
is
rising
but
slowly
just
the
same
the
stream
functions
are
erratic
and
i
don’t
know
what
to
expect
oh
hello
cutie
i
thought
you
were
supervising
the
installation
of
the
new
drive
bar
it’s
done
said
the
robot
quietly
and
so
i’ve
come
to
have
a
talk
with
the
two
of
you
oh
powell
looked
uncomfortable
well
sit
down
no
not
that
chair
one
of
the
legs
is
weak
and
you’re
no
lightweight
the
robot
did
so
and
said
placidly
i
have
come
to
a
decision
donovan
glowered
and
put
the
remnants
of
his
sandwich
aside
if
it’s
on
any
of
that
screwy
the
other
motioned
impatiently
for
silence
go
ahead
cutie
we’re
listening
i
have
spent
these
last
two
days
in
concentrated
introspection
said
cutie
and
the
results
have
been
most
interesting
i
began
at
the
one
sure
assumption
i
felt
permitted
to
make
i
myself
exist
because
i
think
powell
groaned
oh
jupiter
a
robot
descartes
who’s
descartes
demanded
donovan
listen
do
we
have
to
sit
here
and
listen
to
this
metal
maniac
keep
quiet
mike
cutie
continued
imperturbably
and
the
question
that
immediately
arose
was
just
what
is
the
cause
of
my
existence
powell’s
jaw
set
lumpily
you’re
being
foolish
i
told
you
already
that
we
made
you
and
if
you
don’t
believe
us
added
donovan
we’ll
gladly
take
you
apart
the
robot
spread
his
strong
hands
in
a
deprecatory
gesture
i
accept
nothing
on
authority
a
hypothesis
must
be
backed
by
reason
or
else
it
is
worthless

and
it
goes
against
all
the
dictates
of
logic
to
suppose
that
you
made
me
powell
dropped
a
restraining
arm
upon
donovan’s
suddenly
bunched
fist
just
why
do
you
say
that
cutie
laughed
it
was
a
very
inhuman
laugh

the
most
machine-like
utterance
he
had
yet
given
vent
to
it
was
sharp
and
explosive
as
regular
as
a
metronome
and
as
uninflected
look
at
you
he
said
finally
i
say
this
in
no
spirit
of
contempt
but
look
at
you
the
material
you
are
made
of
is
soft
and
flabby
lacking
endurance
and
strength
depending
for
energy
upon
the
inefficient
oxidation
of
organic
material

like
that
he
pointed
a
disapproving
finger
at
what
remained
of
donovan’s
sandwich
periodically
you
pass
into
a
coma
and
the
least
variation
in
temperature
air
pressure
humidity
or
radiation
intensity
impairs
your
efficiency
you
are
makeshift
i
on
the
other
hand
am
a
finished
product
i
absorb
electrical
energy
directly
and
utilize
it
with
an
almost
one
hundred
percent
efficiency
i
am
composed
of
strong
metal
am
continuously
conscious
and
can
stand
extremes
of
environment
easily
these
are
facts
which
with
the
self-evident
proposition
that
no
being
can
create
another
being
superior
to
itself
smashes
your
silly
hypothesis
to
nothing
donovan’s
muttered
curses
rose
into
intelligibility
as
he
sprang
to
his
feet
rusty
eyebrows
drawn
low
all
right
you
son
of
a
hunk
of
iron
ore
if
we
didn’t
make
you
who
did
cutie
nodded
gravely
very
good
donovan
that
was
indeed
the
next
question
evidently
my
creator
must
be
more
powerful
than
myself
and
so
there
was
only
one
possibility
the
earthmen
looked
blank
and
cutie
continued
what
is
the
center
of
activities
here
in
the
station
what
do
we
all
serve
what
absorbs
all
our
attention
he
waited
expectantly
donovan
turned
a
startled
look
upon
his
companion
i’ll
bet
this
tinplated
screwball
is
talking
about
the
energy
converter
itself
is
that
right
cutie
grinned
powell
i
am
talking
about
the
master
came
the
cold
sharp
answer
it
was
the
signal
for
a
roar
of
laughter
from
donovan
and
powell
himself
dissolved
into
a
half-suppressed
giggle
cutie
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
his
gleaming
eyes
passed
from
one
earthman
to
the
other
it
is
so
just
the
same
and
i
don’t
wonder
that
you
refuse
to
believe
you
two
are
not
long
to
stay
here
i’m
sure
powell
himself
said
that
at
first
only
men
served
the
master
that
there
followed
robots
for
the
routine
work
and
finally
myself
for
the
executive
labor
the
facts
are
no
doubt
true
but
the
explanation
entirely
illogical
do
you
want
the
truth
behind
it
all
go
ahead
cutie
you’re
amusing
the
master
created
humans
first
as
the
lowest
type
most
easily
formed
gradually
he
replaced
them
by
robots
the
next
higher
step
and
finally
he
created
me
to
take
the
place
of
the
last
humans
from
now
on
i
serve
the
master
you’ll
do
nothing
of
the
sort
said
powell
sharply
you’ll
follow
our
orders
and
keep
quiet
until
we’re
satisfied
that
you
can
run
the
converter
get
that
the
converter

not
the
master
if
you
don’t
satisfy
us
you
will
be
dismantled
and
now

if
you
don’t
mind

you
can
leave
and
take
this
data
with
you
and
file
it
properly
cutie
accepted
the
graphs
handed
him
and
left
without
another
word
donovan
leaned
back
heavily
in
his
chair
and
shoved
thick
fingers
through
his
hair
there’s
going
to
be
trouble
with
that
robot
he’s
pure
nuts
the
drowsy
hum
of
the
converter
is
louder
in
the
control
room
and
mixed
with
it
is
the
chuckle
of
the
geiger
counters
and
the
erratic
buzzing
of
half
a
dozen
little
signal
lights
donovan
withdrew
his
eye
from
the
telescope
and
flashed
the
luxites
on
the
beam
from
station
4
caught
mars
on
schedule
we
can
break
ours
now
powell
nodded
abstractedly
cutie’s
down
in
the
engine
room
i’ll
flash
the
signal
and
he
can
take
care
of
it
look
mike
what
do
you
think
of
these
figures
the
other
cocked
an
eye
at
them
and
whistled
boy
that’s
what
i
call
gamma-ray
intensity
old
sol
is
feeling
his
oats
all
right
yeah
was
the
sour
response
and
we’re
in
a
bad
position
for
an
electron
storm
too
our
earth
beam
is
right
in
the
probable
path
he
shoved
his
chair
away
from
the
table
pettishly
nuts
if
it
would
only
hold
off
till
relief
got
here
but
that’s
ten
days
off
say
mike
go
on
down
and
keep
an
eye
on
cutie
will
you
o.k
throw
me
some
of
those
almonds
he
snatched
at
the
bag
thrown
him
and
headed
for
the
elevator
it
slid
smoothly
downward
and
opened
onto
a
narrow
catwalk
in
the
huge
engine
room
donovan
leaned
over
the
railing
and
looked
down
the
huge
generators
were
in
motion
and
from
the
l-tubes
came
the
low-pitched
whir
that
pervaded
the
entire
station
he
could
make
out
cutie’s
large
gleaming
figure
at
the
martian
l-tube
watching
closely
as
the
team
of
robots
worked
in
close-knit
unison
and
then
donovan
stiffened
the
robots
dwarfed
by
the
mighty
l-tube
lined
up
before
it
heads
bowed
at
a
stiff
angle
while
cutie
walked
up
and
down
the
line
slowly
fifteen
seconds
passed
and
then
with
a
clank
heard
above
the
clamorous
purring
all
about
they
fell
to
their
knees
donovan
squawked
and
raced
down
the
narrow
staircase
he
came
charging
down
upon
them
complexion
matching
his
hair
and
clenched
fists
beating
the
air
furiously
what
the
devil
is
this
you
brainless
lumps
come
on
get
busy
with
that
l-tube
if
you
don’t
have
it
apart
cleaned
and
together
again
before
the
day
is
out
i’ll
coagulate
your
brains
with
alternating
current
not
a
robot
moved
even
cutie
at
the
far
end

the
only
one
on
his
feet

remained
silent
eyes
fixed
upon
the
gloomy
recesses
of
the
vast
machine
before
him
donovan
shoved
hard
against
the
nearest
robot
stand
up
he
roared
slowly
the
robot
obeyed
his
photoelectric
eyes
focused
reproachfully
upon
the
earthman
there
is
no
master
but
the
master
he
said
and
qt-1
is
his
prophet
huh
donovan
became
aware
of
twenty
pairs
of
mechanical
eyes
fixed
upon
him
and
twenty
stiff-timbered
voices
declaiming
solemnly
there
is
no
master
but
the
master
and
qt-1
is
his
prophet
i’m
afraid
put
in
cutie
himself
at
this
point
that
my
friends
obey
a
higher
one
than
you
now
the
hell
they
do
you
get
out
of
here
i’ll
settle
with
you
later
and
with
these
animated
gadgets
right
now
cutie
shook
his
heavy
head
slowly
i’m
sorry
but
you
don’t
understand
these
are
robots

and
that
means
they
are
reasoning
beings
they
recognize
the
master
now
that
i
have
preached
truth
to
them
all
the
robots
do
they
call
me
the
prophet
his
head
drooped
i
am
unworthy

but
perhaps
donovan
located
his
breath
and
put
it
to
use
is
that
so
now
isn’t
that
nice
now
isn’t
that
just
fine
just
let
me
tell
you
something
my
brass
baboon
there
isn’t
any
master
and
there
isn’t
any
prophet
and
there
isn’t
any
question
as
to
who’s
giving
the
orders
understand
his
voice
shot
to
a
roar
now
get
out
i
obey
only
the
master
damn
the
master
donovan
spat
at
the
l-tube
that
for
the
master
do
as
i
say
cutie
said
nothing
nor
did
any
other
robot
but
donovan
became
aware
of
a
sudden
heightening
of
tension
the
cold
staring
eyes
deepened
their
crimson
and
cutie
seemed
stiffer
than
ever
sacrilege
he
whispered

voice
metallic
with
emotion
donovan
felt
the
first
sudden
touch
of
fear
as
cutie
approached
a
robot
could
not
feel
anger

but
cutie’s
eyes
were
unreadable
i
am
sorry
donovan
said
the
robot
but
you
can
no
longer
stay
here
after
this
henceforth
powell
and
you
are
barred
from
the
control
room
and
the
engine
room
his
hand
gestured
quietly
and
in
a
moment
two
robots
had
pinned
donovan’s
arms
to
his
sides
donovan
had
time
for
one
startled
gasp
as
he
felt
himself
lifted
from
the
floor
and
carried
up
the
stairs
at
a
pace
rather
better
than
a
canter
gregory
powell
raced
up
and
down
the
officer’s
room
fist
tightly
balled
he
cast
a
look
of
furious
frustration
at
the
closed
door
and
scowled
bitterly
at
donovan
why
the
devil
did
you
have
to
spit
at
the
l-tube
mike
donovan
sunk
deep
in
his
chair
slammed
at
its
arms
savagely
what
did
you
expect
me
to
do
with
that
electrified
scarecrow
i’m
not
going
to
knuckle
under
to
any
do-jigger
i
put
together
myself
no
came
back
sourly
but
here
you
are
in
the
officer’s
room
with
two
robots
standing
guard
at
the
door
that’s
not
knuckling
under
is
it
donovan
snarled
wait
till
we
get
back
to
base
someone’s
going
to
pay
for
this
those
robots
must
obey
us
it’s
the
second
law
what’s
the
use
of
saying
that
they
aren’t
obeying
us
and
there’s
probably
some
reason
for
it
that
we’ll
figure
out
too
late
by
the
way
do
you
know
what’s
going
to
happen
to
us
when
we
get
back
to
base
he
stopped
before
donovan’s
chair
and
stared
savagely
at
him
what
oh
nothing
just
back
to
mercury
mines
for
twenty
years
or
maybe
ceres
penitentiary
what
are
you
talking
about
the
electron
storm
that’s
coming
up
do
you
know
it’s
heading
straight
dead
center
across
the
earth
beam
i
had
just
figured
that
out
when
that
robot
dragged
me
out
of
my
chair
donovan
was
suddenly
pale
sizzling
saturn
and
do
you
know
what’s
going
to
happen
to
the
beam

because
the
storm
will
be
a
lulu
it’s
going
to
jump
like
a
flea
with
the
itch
with
only
cutie
at
the
controls
it’s
going
to
go
out
of
focus
and
if
it
does
heaven
help
earth

and
us
donovan
was
wrenching
at
the
door
wildly
when
powell
was
only
half
through
the
door
opened
and
the
earthman
shot
through
to
come
up
hard
against
an
immovable
steel
arm
the
robot
stared
abstractedly
at
the
panting
struggling
earthman
the
prophet
orders
you
to
remain
please
do
his
arm
shoved
donovan
reeled
backward
and
as
he
did
so
cutie
turned
the
corner
at
the
far
end
of
the
corridor
he
motioned
the
guardian
robots
away
entered
the
officer’s
room
and
closed
the
door
gently
donovan
whirled
on
cutie
in
breathless
indignation
this
has
gone
far
enough
you’re
going
to
pay
for
this
farce
please
don’t
be
annoyed
replied
the
robot
mildly
it
was
bound
to
come
eventually
anyway
you
see
you
two
have
lost
your
function
i
beg
your
pardon
powell
drew
himself
up
stiffly
just
what
do
you
mean
we’ve
lost
our
function
until
i
was
created
answered
cube
you
tended
the
master
that
privilege
is
mine
now
and
your
only
reason
for
existence
has
vanished
isn’t
that
obvious
not
quite
replied
powell
bitterly
but
what
do
you
expect
us
to
do
now
cutie
did
not
answer
immediately
he
remained
silent
as
if
in
thought
and
then
one
arm
shot
out
and
draped
itself
about
powell’s
shoulder
the
other
grasped
donovan’s
wrist
and
drew
him
closer
i
like
you
two
you’re
inferior
creatures
with
poor
reasoning
faculties
but
i
really
feel
a
sort
of
affection
for
you
you
have
served
the
master
well
and
he
will
reward
you
for
that
now
that
your
service
is
over
you
will
probably
not
exist
much
longer
but
as
long
as
you
do
you
shall
be
provided
food
clothing
and
shelter
so
long
as
you
stay
out
of
the
control
room
and
the
engine
room
he’s
pensioning
us
off
greg
yelled
donovan
do
something
about
it
it’s
humiliating
look
here
cutie
we
can’t
stand
for
this
we’re
the
bosses
this
station
is
only
a
creation
of
human
beings
like
me

human
beings
that
live
on
earth
and
other
planets
this
is
only
an
energy
relay
you’re
only

aw
nuts
cutie
shook
his
head
gravely
this
amounts
to
an
obsession
why
should
you
insist
so
on
an
absolutely
false
view
of
life
admitted
that
non-robots
lack
the
reasoning
faculty
there
is
still
the
problem
of
his
voice
died
into
reflective
silence
and
donovan
said
with
whispered
intensity
if
you
only
had
a
flesh-and-blood
face
i
would
break
it
in
powell’s
fingers
were
in
his
mustache
and
his
eyes
were
slitted
listen
cutie
if
there
is
no
such
thing
as
earth
how
do
you
account
for
what
you
see
through
a
telescope
pardon
me
the
earthman
smiled
i’ve
got
you
eh
you’ve
made
quite
a
few
telescopic
observations
since
being
put
together
cutie
have
you
noticed
that
several
of
those
specks
of
light
outside
become
disks
when
so
viewed
oh
that
why
certainly
it
is
simple
magnification

for
the
purpose
of
more
exact
aiming
of
the
beam
why
aren’t
the
stars
equally
magnified
then
you
mean
the
other
dots
well
no
beams
go
to
them
so
no
magnification
is
necessary
really
powell
even
you
ought
to
be
able
to
figure
these
things
out
powell
stared
bleakly
upward
but
you
see
more
stars
through
a
telescope
where
do
they
come
from
jumping
jupiter
where
do
they
come
from
cutie
was
annoyed
listen
powell
do
you
think
i’m
going
to
waste
my
time
trying
to
pin
physical
interpretations
upon
every
optical
illusion
of
our
instruments
since
when
is
the
evidence
of
our
senses
any
match
for
the
clear
light
of
rigid
reason
look
clamored
donovan
suddenly
writhing
out
from
under
cutie’s
friendly
but
metal-heavy
arm
let’s
get
to
the
nub
of
the
thing
why
the
beams
at
all
we’re
giving
you
a
good
logical
explanation
can
you
do
better
the
beams
was
the
stiff
reply
are
put
out
by
the
master
for
his
own
purposes
there
are
some
things

he
raised
his
eyes
devoutly
upward
that
are
not
to
be
probed
into
by
us
in
this
matter
i
seek
only
to
serve
and
not
to
question
powell
sat
down
slowly
and
buried
his
face
in
shaking
hands
get
out
of
here
cutie
get
out
and
let
me
think
i’ll
send
you
food
said
cutie
agreeably
a
groan
was
the
only
answer
and
the
robot
left
greg
was
donovan’s
huskily
whispered
observation
this
calls
for
strategy
we’ve
got
to
get
him
when
he
isn’t
expecting
it
and
short-circuit
him
concentrated
nitric
acid
in
his
joints
don’t
be
a
dope
mike
do
you
suppose
he’s
going
to
let
us
get
near
him
with
acid
in
our
hands
we’ve
got
to
talk
to
him
i
tell
you
we’ve
got
to
argue
him
into
letting
us
back
into
the
control
room
inside
of
forty-eight
hours
or
our
goose
is
broiled
to
a
crisp
he
rocked
back
and
forth
in
an
agony
of
impotence
who
the
heck
wants
to
argue
with
a
robot
it’s
it’s
mortifying
finished
donovan
worse
say
donovan
laughed
suddenly
why
argue
let’s
show
him
let’s
build
us
another
robot
right
before
his
eyes
he’ll
have
to
eat
his
words
then
a
slowly
widening
smile
appeared
on
powell’s
face
donovan
continued
and
think
of
that
screwball’s
face
when
he
sees
us
do
it
robots
are
of
course
manufactured
on
earth
but
their
shipment
through
apace
is
much
simpler
if
it
can
be
done
in
parts
to
be
put
together
at
their
place
of
use
it
also
incidentally
eliminates
the
possibility
of
robots
in
complete
adjustment
wandering
off
while
still
on
earth
and
thus
bringing
u
s
robots
face
to
face
with
the
strict
laws
against
robots
on
earth
still
it
placed
upon
men
such
as
powell
and
donovan
the
necessity
of
synthesis
of
complete
robots
a
grievous
and
complicated
task
powell
and
donovan
were
never
so
aware
of
that
fact
as
upon
that
particular
day
when
in
the
assembly
room
they
undertook
to
create
a
robot
under
the
watchful
eyes
of
qt-1
prophet
of
the
master
the
robot
in
question
a
simple
mc
model
lay
upon
the
table
almost
complete
three
hours
work
left
only
the
head
undone
and
powell
paused
to
swab
his
forehead
and
glanced
uncertainly
at
cutie
the
glance
was
not
a
reassuring
one
for
three
hours
cutie
had
sat
speechless
and
motionless
and
his
face
inexpressive
at
all
times
was
now
absolutely
unreadable
powell
groaned
let’s
get
the
brain
in
now
mike
donovan
uncapped
the
tightly
sealed
container
and
from
the
oil
bath
within
he
withdrew
a
second
cube
opening
this
in
turn
he
removed
a
globe
from
its
sponge-rubber
casing
he
handled
it
gingerly
for
it
was
the
most
complicated
mechanism
ever
created
by
man
inside
the
thin
platinum
plated
skin
of
the
globe
was
a
positronic
brain
in
whose
delicately
unstable
structure
were
enforced
calculated
neuronic
paths
which
imbued
each
robot
with
what
amounted
to
a
pre-natal
education
it
fitted
snugly
into
the
cavity
in
the
skull
of
the
robot
on
the
table
blue
metal
closed
over
it
and
was
welded
tightly
by
the
tiny
atomic
flare
photoelectric
eyes
were
attached
carefully
screwed
tightly
into
place
and
covered
by
thin
transparent
sheets
of
steel-hard
plastic
the
robot
awaited
only
the
vitalizing
flash
of
high-voltage
electricity
and
powell
paused
with
his
hand
on
the
switch
now
watch
this
cutie
watch
this
carefully
the
switch
rammed
home
and
there
was
a
crackling
hum
the
two
earthmen
bent
anxiously
over
their
creation
there
was
vague
motion
only
at
the
outset

a
twitching
of
the
joints
the
head
lifted
elbows
propped
it
up
and
the
mc
model
swung
clumsily
off
the
table
its
footing
was
unsteady
and
twice
abortive
grating
sounds
were
all
it
could
do
in
the
direction
of
speech
finally
its
voice
uncertain
and
hesitant
took
form
i
would
like
to
start
work
where
must
i
go
donovan
sprang
to
the
door
down
these
stairs
he
said
you
will
be
told
what
to
do
the
mc
model
was
gone
and
the
two
earthmen
were
alone
with
the
still
unmoving
cutie
well
said
powell
grinning
now
do
you
believe
that
we
made
you
cutie’s
answer
was
curt
and
final
no
he
said
powell’s
grin
froze
and
then
relaxed
slowly
donovan’s
mouth
dropped
open
and
remained
so
you
see
continued
cutie
easily
you
have
merely
put
together
parts
already
made
you
did
remarkably
well

instinct
i
suppose

but
you
didn’t
really
create
the
robot
the
parts
were
created
by
the
master
listen
gasped
donovan
hoarsely
those
parts
were
manufactured
back
on
earth
and
sent
here
well
well
replied
cutie
soothingly
we
won’t
argue
no
i
mean
it
the
earthman
sprang
forward
and
grasped
the
robot’s
metal
arm
if
you
were
to
read
the
books
in
the
library
they
could
explain
it
so
that
there
could
be
no
possible
doubt
the
books
i’ve
read
them

all
of
them
they’re
most
ingenious
powell
broke
in
suddenly
if
you’ve
read
them
what
else
is
there
to
say
you
can’t
dispute
their
evidence
you
just
can’t
there
was
pity
in
cutie’s
voice
please
powell
i
certainly
don’t
consider
them
a
valid
source
of
information
they
too
were
created
by
the
master

and
were
meant
for
you
not
for
me
how
do
you
make
that
out
demanded
powell
because
i
a
reasoning
being
am
capable
of
deducing
truth
from
a
priori
causes
you
being
intelligent
but
unreasoning
need
an
explanation
of
existence
supplied
to
you
and
this
the
master
did
that
he
supplied
you
with
these
laughable
ideas
of
far-off
worlds
and
people
is
no
doubt
for
the
best
your
minds
are
probably
too
coarsely
grained
for
absolute
truth
however
since
it
is
the
master’s
will
that
you
believe
your
books
i
won’t
argue
with
you
any
more
as
he
left
he
turned
and
said
in
a
kindly
tone
but
don’t
feel
badly
in
the
master’s
scheme
of
things
there
is
room
for
all
you
poor
humans
have
your
place
and
though
it
is
humble
you
will
be
rewarded
if
you
fill
it
well
he
departed
with
a
beatific
air
suiting
the
prophet
of
the
master
and
the
two
humans
avoided
each
other’s
eyes
finally
powell
spoke
with
an
effort
let’s
go
to
bed
mike
i
give
up
donovan
said
in
a
hushed
voice
say
greg
you
don’t
suppose
he’s
right
about
all
this
do
you
he
sounds
so
confident
that
i
powell
whirled
on
him
don’t
be
a
fool
you’d
find
out
whether
earth
exists
when
relief
gets
here
next
week
and
we
have
to
go
back
to
face
the
music
then
for
the
love
of
jupiter
we’ve
got
to
do
something
donovan
was
half
in
tears
he
doesn’t
believe
us
or
the
books
or
his
eyes
no
said
powell
bitterly
he’s
a
reasoning
robot

damn
it
he
believes
only
reason
and
there’s
one
trouble
with
that
his
voice
trailed
away
what’s
that
prompted
donovan
you
can
prove
anything
you
want
by
coldly
logical
reason

if
you
pick
the
proper
postulates
we
have
ours
and
cutie
has
his
then
let’s
get
at
those
postulates
in
a
hurry
the
storm’s
due
tomorrow
powell
sighed
wearily
that’s
where
everything
falls
down
postulates
are
based
on
assumption
and
adhered
to
by
faith
nothing
in
the
universe
can
shake
them
i’m
going
to
bed
oh
hell
i
can’t
sleep
neither
can
i
but
i
might
as
well
try

as
a
matter
of
principle
twelve
hours
later
sleep
was
still
just
that

a
matter
of
principle
unattainable
in
practice
the
storm
had
arrived
ahead
of
schedule
and
donovan’s
florid
face
drained
of
blood
as
he
pointed
a
shaking
finger
powell
stubble-jawed
and
dry-lipped
stared
out
the
port
and
pulled
desperately
at
his
mustache
under
other
circumstances
it
might
have
been
a
beautiful
sight
the
stream
of
high-speed
electrons
impinging
upon
the
energy
beam
fluoresced
into
ultra-spicules
of
intense
light
the
beam
stretched
out
into
shrinking
nothingness
a-glitter
with
dancing
shining
motes
the
shaft
of
energy
was
steady
but
the
two
earthmen
knew
the
value
of
naked-eyed
appearances
deviations
in
arc
of
a
hundredth
of
a
millisecond

invisible
to
the
eye

were
enough
to
send
the
beam
wildly
out
of
focus

enough
to
blast
hundreds
of
square
miles
of
earth
into
incandescent
ruin
and
a
robot
unconcerned
with
beam
focus
or
earth
or
anything
but
his
master
was
at
the
controls
hours
passed
the
earthmen
watched
in
hypnotized
silence
and
then
the
darting
dotlets
of
light
dimmed
and
went
out
the
storm
had
ended
powell’s
voice
was
flat
it’s
over
donovan
had
fallen
into
a
troubled
slumber
and
powell’s
weary
eyes
rested
upon
him
enviously
the
signal-flash
glared
over
and
over
again
but
the
earthman
paid
no
attention
it
all
was
unimportant
all
perhaps
cutie
was
right

and
he
was
only
an
inferior
being
with
a
made-to-order
memory
and
a
life
that
had
outlived
its
purpose
he
wished
he
were
cutie
was
standing
before
him
you
didn’t
answer
the
flash
so
i
walked
in
his
voice
was
low
you
don’t
look
at
all
well
and
i’m
afraid
your
term
of
existence
is
drawing
to
an
end
still
would
you
like
to
see
some
of
the
readings
recorded
today
dimly
powell
was
aware
that
the
robot
was
making
a
friendly
gesture
perhaps
to
quiet
some
lingering
remorse
in
forcibly
replacing
the
humans
at
the
controls
of
the
station
he
accepted
the
sheets
held
out
to
him
and
gazed
at
them
unseeingly
cutie
seemed
pleased
of
course
it
is
a
great
privilege
to
serve
the
master
you
mustn’t
feel
too
badly
about
my
having
replaced
you
powell
grunted
and
shifted
from
one
sheet
to
the
other
mechanically
until
his
blurred
sight
focused
upon
a
thin
red
line
that
wobbled
its
way
across
the
ruled
paper
he
stared

and
stared
again
he
gripped
it
hard
in
both
fists
and
rose
to
his
feet
still
staring
the
other
sheets
dropped
to
the
floor
unheeded
mike
mike
he
was
shaking
the
other
madly
he
held
it
steady
donovan
came
to
life
what
wh-where
and
he
too
gazed
with
bulging
eyes
upon
the
record
before
him
cutie
broke
in
what
is
wrong
you
kept
it
in
focus
stuttered
powell
did
you
know
that
focus
what’s
that
you
kept
the
beam
directed
sharply
at
the
receiving
station

to
within
a
ten-thousandth
of
a
millisecond
of
arc
what
receiving
station
on
earth
the
receiving
station
on
earth
babbled
powell
you
kept
it
in
focus
cutie
turned
on
his
heel
in
annoyance
it
is
impossible
to
perform
any
act
of
kindness
toward
you
two
always
the
same
phantasm
i
merely
kept
all
dials
at
equilibrium
in
accordance
with
the
will
of
the
master
gathering
the
scattered
papers
together
he
withdrew
stiffly
and
donovan
said
as
he
left
well
i’ll
be
damned
he
turned
to
powell
what
are
we
going
to
do
now
powell
felt
tired
but
uplifted
nothing
he’s
just
shown
he
can
run
the
station
perfectly
i’ve
never
seen
an
electron
storm
handled
so
well
but
nothing’s
solved
you
heard
what
he
said
of
the
master
we
can’t
look
mike
he
follows
the
instructions
of
the
master
by
means
of
dials
instruments
and
graphs
that’s
all
we
ever
followed
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
accounts
for
his
refusal
to
obey
us
obedience
is
the
second
law
no
harm
to
humans
is
the
first
how
can
he
keep
humans
from
harm
whether
he
knows
it
or
not
why
by
keeping
the
energy
beam
stable
he
knows
he
can
keep
it
more
stable
than
we
can
since
he
insists
he’s
the
superior
being
so
he
must
keep
us
out
of
the
control
room
it’s
inevitable
if
you
consider
the
laws
of
robotics
sure
but
that’s
not
the
point
we
can’t
let
him
continue
this
nitwit
stuff
about
the
master
why
not
because
whoever
heard
of
such
a
damned
thing
how
are
we
going
to
trust
him
with
the
station
if
he
doesn’t
believe
in
earth
can
he
handle
the
station
yes
but
then
what’s
the
difference
what
he
believes
powell
spread
his
arms
outward
with
a
vague
smile
upon
his
face
and
tumbled
backward
onto
the
bed
he
was
asleep
powell
was
speaking
while
struggling
into
his
lightweight
space
jacket
it
would
be
a
simple
job
he
said
you
can
bring
in
new
qt
models
one
by
one
equip
them
with
an
automatic
shutoff
switch
to
act
within
the
week
so
as
to
allow
them
enough
time
to
learn
the
uh
cult
of
the
master
from
the
prophet
himself
then
switch
them
to
another
station
and
revitalize
them
we
could
have
two
qt’s
per
donovan
unclasped
his
glassite
visor
and
scowled
shut
up
and
let’s
get
out
of
here
relief
is
waiting
and
i
won’t
feel
right
until
i
actually
see
earth
and
feel
the
ground
under
my
feet

just
to
make
sure
it’s
really
there
the
door
opened
as
he
spoke
and
donovan
with
a
smothered
curse
clicked
the
visor
to
and
turned
a
sulky
back
upon
cutie
the
robot
approached
softly
and
there
was
sorrow
in
his
voice
you
are
going
powell
nodded
curtly
there
will
be
others
in
our
place
cutie
sighed
with
the
sound
of
wind
humming
through
closely
spaced
wires
your
term
of
service
is
over
and
the
time
of
dissolution
has
come
i
expected
it
but

well
the
master’s
will
be
done
his
tone
of
resignation
stung
powell
save
the
sympathy
cube
we’re
heading
for
earth
not
dissolution
it
is
best
that
you
think
so
cutie
sighed
again
i
see
the
wisdom
of
the
illusion
now
i
would
not
attempt
to
shake
your
faith
even
if
i
could
he
departed

the
picture
of
commiseration
powell
snarled
and
motioned
to
donovan
sealed
suitcases
in
hand
they
headed
for
the
air
lock
the
relief
ship
was
on
the
outer
landing
and
franz
muller
his
relief
man
greeted
them
with
stiff
courtesy
donovan
made
scant
acknowledgment
and
passed
into
the
pilot
room
to
take
over
the
controls
from
sam
evans
powell
lingered
how’s
earth
it
was
a
conventional
enough
question
and
muller
gave
the
conventional
answer
still
spinning
powell
said
good
muller
looked
at
him
the
boys
back
at
the
u
s
robots
have
dreamed
up
a
new
one
by
the
way
a
multiple
robot
a
what
what
i
said
there’s
a
big
contract
for
it
it
must
be
just
the
thing
for
asteroid
mining
you
have
a
master
robot
with
six
sub-robots
under
it
like
your
fingers
has
it
been
field-tested
asked
powell
anxiously
muller
smiled
waiting
for
you
i
hear
powell’s
fist
balled
damn
it
we
need
a
vacation
oh
you’ll
get
it
two
weeks
i
think
he
was
donning
the
heavy
space
gloves
in
preparation
for
his
term
of
duty
here
and
his
thick
eyebrows
drew
close
together
how
is
this
new
robot
getting
along
it
better
be
good
or
i’ll
be
damned
if
i
let
it
touch
the
controls
powell
paused
before
answering
his
eyes
swept
the
proud
prussian
before
him
from
the
close-cropped
hair
on
the
sternly
stubborn
head
to
the
feet
standing
stiffly
at
attention

and
there
was
a
sudden
glow
of
pure
gladness
surging
through
him
the
robot
is
pretty
good
he
said
slowly
i
don’t
think
you’ll
have
to
bother
much
with
the
controls
he
grinned

and
went
into
the
ship
muller
would
be
here
for
several
weeks
